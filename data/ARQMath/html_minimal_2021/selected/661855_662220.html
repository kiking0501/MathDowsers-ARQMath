<p>A child asked me this question yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p>Would it be faster to count to the infinite going <em>one by one</em> or <em>two by two</em>?</p> </blockquote> <p>And I was split with two answers:</p> <ul> <li>In both case it will take an infinite time.</li> <li>Skipping half of the number should be really faster.</li> </ul> <p>Which brings me this question:</p> <p><strong>Could an infinite be greater than another one?</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to the common layman assumption, there is no unique context in which mathematics is being done. Words, especially coming from natural language, can be interpreted in different ways when changing the context.</p> <p>In this case, the word "faster" can be interpreted in different ways, and it will affect the answer.</p> <ol> <li><p>"Faster" as a real valued limit. We can think about this as two functions, <span class="math-container" id="6674263" visual_id="2192"><math alttext="f(n)=n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="6674264" visual_id="175867"><math alttext="g(n)=2n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. These can be thought as sequences of real numbers, and we can ask whether or not one sequence dominates the other, and what is the limit of their ratios? <span class="math-container" id="6674265" visual_id="4453075"><math alttext="\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=\frac{1}{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><munder><mo movablelimits="false">lim</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></munder><mo>⁡</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></semantics></math></span> Since <span class="math-container" id="6674266" visual_id="885124"><math alttext="\frac{1}{2}&lt;1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> we have that indeed <span class="math-container" id="6674267" visual_id="627"><math alttext="g" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>g</mi></semantics></math></span> is the faster sequence.</p></li> <li><p>"Faster" as a computational process. This is similar to the above case, we define two sequences and calculate the limit of their ratios. However this time we say that if the ratio is a positive (but finite!) constant, then they are more or less the same speed. In this case both sequences have the same "speed".</p></li> <li><p>"Faster" as a set theoretic process (cardinality). This is not similar to the two cases above, in this case we only measure the cardinality of the output of the sequence. We can ask whether or not the cardinality, which is the rawest notion of "size" for sets, of the two sets <span class="math-container" id="6674268" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="6674269" visual_id="2303716"><math alttext="\{2n\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><mo>∣</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>ℕ</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> are the same, despite one being a proper subset of the other.</p> <p>The answer here is that the cardinality is the same, because there is a bijection between the two sets, indeed <span class="math-container" id="6674270" visual_id="175867"><math alttext="g(n)=2n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is this bijection. So the two methods of counting end up having the same "speed" again.</p></li> </ol> <p>There are definitely more ways to define which sets go "faster" to infinity. And the result will definitely change from one context to another. The point is that there are different ways we can measure how fast a particular set of integers, or a sequence if you will, thins out as it grows, and it is useful to consider different ways in different contexts.</p> <p>If you want to explain to a child about the importance of context in which a term is interpreted, ask them what it is easier to carry a <span class="math-container" id="6674271" visual_id="544799"><math alttext="5\ \rm kg" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mn>5</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>kg</mi></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span> of iron cast into one block, or a balloon containing <span class="math-container" id="6674272" visual_id="4453076"><math alttext="1\ \rm kg" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mn>1</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>kg</mi></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span> of air which is huge (<span class="math-container" id="6674273" visual_id="4453077"><math alttext="0.85\rm m^{3}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.85</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span> in volume). While the iron is definitely heavier, the balloon is definitely much larger and more difficult to handle.</p> <p>So carrying it by hand makes the iron easier to carry. But if you have a cart on which you can put both objects, then the balloon is much easier to carry because you are pulling a lighter object and you have to put less effort into that.</p> <p>Therefore there are two ways to interpret "easier to carry" and they depend on the the tools that you have, and so "faster" in mathematics depends on the context in which you are asking the question.</p>
