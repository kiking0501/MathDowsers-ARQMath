Your question is a very important one which is easily "swept under the rug". You are justified in questioning the method. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085216"> @Somos Glad to read I was not completely confused.  I'll look up the Law of the excluded middle in hopes of more clarity.  Thanks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085486"> @Somos: Proof by contradiction does not rely on the law of the excluded middle: it only requires the law of noncontradiction. The invocation of the law of the excluded middle that is often associated with a proof by contradiction is about proving a proposition from its double negation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085668"> Possible duplicate of [Are proofs by contradiction really logical?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1667884/are-proofs-by-contradiction-really-logical) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085675"> Athough what Hurkyl said above is true for **some** definitions of "proof by contradiction", the typical variant that mathematics students encounter in textbooks and classes are actually of the form "<span class="math-container" id="22781667" visual_id="3470208"><math alttext="\neg A\to\bot\vdash A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mo>⊥</mo><mo>⊢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>", which **does** require LEM (the law of excluded middle) to justify fully. Hence I think the link I've provided will give a fuller answer to your question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086493"> @somos It is also worth pointing out that the problem Stephen is asking about has nothing to do with the excluded middle, but rather with there not being contradictions in the axioms. Of course for (I want to say most) a fair amount of proofs by contradiction you don't actually need to prove the result that way it's just easier. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086542"> It is also worth noting that people sometme make mistakes and so if you end up in a contradiction one possibility is that a mistake in reasoning is the cause. How can you decide between this possibility and/or that the proposition P is false? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086812"> @Somos If you make a direct proof, it is also a possibility that a mistake in reasoning has occurred, how is this any different? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086825"> @Morgan Rodgers Because in a direct proof you can check each of the statements for correctness. In a proof by contradicition you can't. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087619"> @Somos In both cases, you are often going to have difficulty checking the correctness of a given statement (if you could just "check" the correctness of the statement you are trying to prove, why would you need to prove it?). You can only check that each statement you are making is properly justified by the assumptions you have made. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087703"> Checking a statement is not the same as "proving" it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087765"> @DoughnutPump  I now see what you mean. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087778"> <span class="math-container" id="22781751" visual_id="202"><math alttext="Q" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math></span> cannot originate from outside of our system of axioms.  So, either it was *unknowingly*/*accidentally* assumed in the proof (in which case the proof is not a valid one - but not because of the method of a PbC), or it has already been proven in the system in which we are working, in which case, it cannot be the cause of the contradiction (unless some of our axioms are inconsistent - which is by definition false).   So indeed, back to proof-101 - be sure of the veracity of every statement!  To avoid introducing a ''<span class="math-container" id="22781751" visual_id="202"><math alttext="Q" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math></span>'' in it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088917"> @DoughnutPump: Your comment is inaccurate. See my answer for an explicit example (at the end) where we can have some assumption that contributes to the contradiction but is totally part of a valid proof. In fact, in many proof systems (especially Fitch-style) you necessarily have to consider assumptions in order to prove certain statements (such as conditional statements), **regardless of** whether you know it's true or not. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088925"> @Somos: Your comment raises an interesting issue, but perhaps it may not be so clear to other readers. What you are saying is that in a direct proof (namely not using LEM or DNE or proof by contradiction) every statement that you deduce is empirically verifiable, whereas in an indirect proof, since you can deduce anything from a contradiction, it's entirely possible that every statement you have deduced under a false assumption is also false, and so one cannot 'double-check' each by testing it independently. That's indeed true, and you may want to look up the BHK interpretation for more. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5089101"> @user21820 Thanks, you got it right. That is what I am claiming. Every statement in a direct proof can be spot checked for validity, In a contradiction proof, statments can be true or false so you have to fall back on making sure that each step follows logically from previous steps. My concern is more for validity of statements than validity of proof methods, although proofs should use valid inferences but it's harder to check. I knew about BHK type interpretations, but I am not into proofs as object of manipulation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5091339"> @Somos: By the way, you're welcome to the [logic chat-room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/44058/logic) if you'd like further discussion, including about the posts I've linked. =) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5096528"> How about a simple case: Where one of the prior assumptions (a1,a2,a3..) was really an assumption, not a logic deduction  Then you might have just injected a proposition that was an alternative to a2.  Now your argument doesn't imply new mathematics but that you inserted a proposition that had a different branch than the internally assumed a2.  Neither is correct or incorrect logically; just inconsistent with each other.  For example, Euclid's parallel line "axiom".  If I have misinterpreted your question, let me know and I will delete this! </td></tr>

I would challenge you to try to, on your own, come up with a mathematical statement such that neither the statement nor its negation is true (or where both are true). I won't hold my breath.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="5086676"> You misrepresent the most common view against the law of the excluded middle, which is not that it is not true, but rather that it should not be considered provable. Good arguments for this include that (1) LEM is usually not necessary (most theorems can be proven constructively); (2) even if that fails, any classical statement using LEM can be translated into a constructive statement that is proven without LEM, or simply proven with an additional hypothesis that LEM holds; (3) LEM is undesirable in logic because, unlike the other laws of inference, it is not simply "true by definition". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086685"> I still like your first paragraph and the second one correctly points out that mathematicians are not bothered by such considerations about the underlying logic. (+1) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086802"> @6005 I'm not intending to represent that as the common argument, though I see how it comes across that way. But yeah, really just trying to say that whether using LEM is the logically appropriate way to approach a proof is more a question for philosophers and logicians. (I would also say that the other answers support this). Mathematicians (in most areas of mathematics) are happy to take the fact that it is true a sufficient justification for using it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5089135"> @MorganRodgers You are assuming that every "mathematical statement" is either true or false or both. What if it is neither true or false? How do you eliminate that possibility? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5089243"> @Somos Give me an example of a statement where that could be a possibility.
