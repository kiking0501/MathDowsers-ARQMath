<p>Is there a good book (or online text) that teaches elementary algebra?</p> <p>The text should focus primarily on practical computation rather than on abstract theory (while still present full proofs). For example, i want to compute the minimal polynomial of the algebraic number <span class="math-container" id="3441290" visual_id="3766506"><math alttext="\sqrt[3]{5}+\sqrt[5]{3}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mroot><mn>5</mn><mn>3</mn></mroot><mo>+</mo><mroot><mn>3</mn><mn>5</mn></mroot></mrow></semantics></math></span>. How do i do that?</p> <p>Most algebra books i have seen are far too abstract. They dive deep into abstractions and lose touch with elementary algebraic questions. I don't want to first learn about categories, exact sequences and the like, just to be able to solve some supposedly simple concrete algebra exercises.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="688668"> From what I can understand, you want an elementary _abstract_ algebra book focusing on computation. I've retagged the algebra-precalculus tag as abstract algebra. If the precalculus tag was intentional then please roll back the edit. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="688718"> I want a _concrete_ not abstract algebra book teaching polynomials and equations with integer coefficients. I think both tags algebra-precalculus and abstract-algebra don't capture it. </td></tr>

<p>I'm a fan of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0130047635" rel="nofollow">Artin's <em>Algebra</em></a>.  J. S. Milne also has some <a href="http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/index.html" rel="nofollow">online course notes</a> covering group theory, field theory, and Galois theory which are quite nice.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that, distasteful though they may be right now, many abstractions such as exact sequences are defined precisely in order to help us compute things.  One could even say that the purpose of algebra is to define abstractions that help with computations.  You have every right to demand motivation for such things when they appear, but you shouldn't avoid them entirely.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="688805"> Thank you. But I think there should be a more direkt way. Why are there no textbooks that just continue with _concrete_ algebra where high school algebra ended? It cannot be that complicated to compute a minimal polynomial of a simple algebraic number. So in the spirit of Bourbaki, either you make it through hundreds of pages of general abstract nonsense or you never have a chance to even solve basic algebraic problems. Something is clearly going wrong here... </td></tr>
