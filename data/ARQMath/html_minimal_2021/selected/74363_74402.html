Matrices are a **special case**, so it works "for matrices specifically" because *it always works for functions*. It's not "hiding the reason it works for matrices", it's *explaining* the reason it works for matrices: because matrices are "really" functions, and this is a property of *functions*. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="175758"> More interesting is why a square matrix is left-invertible iff it is right-invertible. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="175777"> @Arturo Magidin - This sheds no light over why the same "recipe" works both on rows and columns of A to create I. I'm not asking about the forest, but about the tree. Can you honestly say you "understand" why the inverse C combines both rows and columns of A into I. All you have right now is a mechanical syntactic proof. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="175778"> You keep missing my point: I "understand" because I know that <span class="math-container" id="834548" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> is **really** a function, so as soon as you know that it has inverses on both sides, the inverses have to be the same one; it's not about "recipes", it's about **correspondences**: the matrix <span class="math-container" id="834548" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> is a one-to-one onto correspondence; the matrix <span class="math-container" id="834496" visual_id="505"><math alttext="C" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>C</mi></semantics></math></span> is the exact same correspondence "pointing the other way".

<p>Arturo's response above is a very good one-as usual-but here's another way to approach the problem: Since the set of invertible n x n matrices is a non-commutative group under matrix multiplication, what you're really asking is why the right inverse of every element in a group is also a left inverse. This property is really true because the set of invertible matrices is a group and it's true of groups in general.</p> <p>If you're unfamiliar with algebra, a group is defined as follows:  A group is a set, G, together with an binary operation (i.e. a function from GxG into G)  • (called the group law of G) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted a • b or ab. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, •), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms: i)Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G. ii)Associativity:For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c). iii)Identity element:There exists an element e in G, such that for every element a in G, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. The identity element of a group G is often written as 1 or 1G, a notation inherited from the multiplicative identity. iv)Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a • b = b • a = 1.  It's pretty easy to prove the set of all invertible n x n matrices is a group under matrix multiplication. Notice it's usually assumed in the definition that the identity is unique and 2 sided and each inverse of every element is 2 sided and unique to the element. However, it's not necessary to do so. One can modify the axioms of a group so it's not assumed the inverses are 2 sided: i.e. Define a group G to be nonempty set closed under a associative binary operation * such that 1) there exists at least one element e for all elements a in G such that e*a = a and 2) for every element a, there is at least one element b such that b*a= e. You can of course, alternatively define an identity on the right and inverses on the right. The point here is to not assume the 2 sided-ness of the identity and the inverses and you should try and prove that every left identity(inverse) must also be a right.You then prove that each left is unique and so is every right-therefore, they're equal. It's a bit tedious, but I think you'll find it to answer your question in a decisive fashion. </p> <p>Another way-consider the following:Modify the above definition of a group so that e is a LEFT identity and for every element, there is a right inverse. Is the resulting set under a binary operation a group? It turns out the answer is NO. For a counterexample, define a*b=b for all a and b in the group. Then we can pick any e to be the left identity of all the elements. Similarly, any b has the right inverse e because b*e=e.In the trivial case of a group-a single element e-this is clearly a group. BUT if there is more than one element, the result is NOT a group: If a*x=a and b*x=b, then x=a and x=b, which obviously can't hold in the general case because there is no single (two-sided) identity element!</p> <p>Do the exercise above in the alternate definition of a group with the weaker axioms-this plus the counterexample should clear the fog of your confusion. </p>

I don't think that that's what is being asked here. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176004"> @t.b. I was assuming that the set of all n x n invertible matrices formed a group under multiplication-which it does-and then showing why in general for any group, a unique right inverse element must be equal to a unique left inverse element.In fact,the definition of an invertible matrix in particular doesn't even come up once we assert that the set of all n x n invertible matrices is a group under matrix multiplication. Then the argument is pure group theory. And look at what was asked:"Looking for insightful explanation as to why right inverse equals left inverse for square invt. matrices." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176006"> @t.b. cont. There,I clarified the argument more with another line added. Is it clear now? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176010"> @Mathemagician1234 : I think you are missing the point of the question.  The OP is clearly aware that invertible matrices form a group -- in the question statement, he gave the usual group-theoretic proof that a left inverse and a right inverse have to be equal (using associativity).  Adding the word "group" to this does not clarify anything. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176012"> @Mathemagician1234: This is really just another instance of the situation for functions, since any element of a group/monoid can be seen as a function (via the Cayley representation)... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176018"> @t.b., Adam: Are you guys serious?!? The OP seems to be working strictly from properties of matrices.Are we reading the same question?

But as I was telling t.b. and Adam,the language used by the O.P. suggests a student with no knowledge of abstract group theory and is working strictly from the properties of matrices. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="176021"> @Mathemagician1234 : I have no idea whether the OP knows the word "group", but he knows the "group-theory proof" that left and right inverses agree.

Of course, I am not taking sides on this matter but if you do not respond to Adam's comments, then there can be no conflict. Why do you let the comments of other people bother you when you do not even personally know the people?
