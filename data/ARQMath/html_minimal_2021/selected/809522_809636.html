<p>From Wikipedia, we have:</p> <blockquote> <p>In natural languages, an indicative conditional is the logical operation given by statements of the form "If A then B". Unlike the material conditional, an indicative conditional does not have a stipulated definition. The philosophical literature on this operation is broad, and no clear consensus has been reached.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_conditional" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_conditional</a></p> <p>Is it not just a case of disallowing certain rules of inference in propositional logic, e.g. disallowing <span class="math-container" id="7938356" visual_id="3844981"><math alttext="\neg A\to A\implies B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mo>→</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>⟹</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> or some other rule(s) of inference that allows you do make such an inference?</p> <p>I routinely use such rules (as above) in writing formal proofs. Would mathematics as we know it even be possible if we implemented such restrictions? </p>

<p>The indicative conditional describes an ordering of the truth values of statements: B is not less true than A. The various paradoxes and problems of the material conditional become perfectly reasonable with this interpretation, and no more mysterious than claiming that A &lt;= B. </p> <p>For classical two valued logic, the material conditional happens to describe the same relationship, and it is perfectly adequate for the job.  But this success is misleading and even tends to obscure understanding of it. </p> <p>In three valued logic, it turns out that doubts about the adequacy of the material conditional are well justified. It does not have the same useful, valuable properties in the three valued case that it does in the two valued case: and a conditional corresponding to an ordering of truth values has much better correspondence with the indicative conditional. </p>

<tr><td comment_id="1680131"> The Drinker's paradox is true whether or not anyone at all in the pub is drinking, because a conditional with a false antecedent is technically true. It is also vacuous and gives no information. It would be a different matter if we could assume also that there is at least one person who is drinking (which there is a strong temptation to do anyway), but that would be a different,  contingent  statement and no longer a paradox. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1680333"> In the Drinker's Paradox, no one has to be drinking, but there has to be someone in the pub (i.e. a non-empty universe). </td></tr>
