<p>At school, I really struggled to understand the concept of imaginary numbers.  My teacher told us that an imaginary number is a number that has something to do with the square root of <span class="math-container" id="2298522" visual_id="343"><math alttext="-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>.  When I tried to calculate the square root of <span class="math-container" id="2298523" visual_id="343"><math alttext="-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> on my calculator, it gave me an error.  To this day I still do not understand imaginary numbers.  It makes no sense to me at all.  Is there someone here who totally gets it and can explain it?</p> <p>Why is the concept even useful?</p>

Mind you, you'll still get real numbers when you do the mathematics that would result in most things that you'd expect a real number for (distance between two numbers on the complex plane is still a real number, as are the magnitudes of imaginary vectors). In a related manner, there are alternate formulations of quantum mechanics which involve negative probabilities instead, but I understand it makes the math more complex.

I would have said, for example, that while Santa Claus does not exist, the *idea* of Santa Claus certainly does exist. The widespread belief in God renders God an important *idea* that I should study and understand regardless of whether or not I believe that God actually exists; the *idea* of God certainly exists and has had a profound effect on the world.

Without the complex numbers we cannot describe it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="458414"> @MakotoKato: I agree with you insofar that the idea of atoms is very real, and it very neatly describes the small thingies we're seeing through a microscope.

This is exactly what I am disagreeing. The complex numbers were "discovered" in 16th century, long before they were used in the Schrödinger equation. Nobody dreamdt of quantum physics at that time. If they are just an idea like a story, how come they are used essentially in the equation which describes the fundamental law of the universe? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461010"> @MakotoKato: To answer this question, let me ask another question: All theories are written in some language, be it Latin, English, German or whatever. Using a language turns out to be essential for writing theories; you couldn't do it without. Should I conclude that languages are not a construct of the human mind, but somehow part of the intrinsic structure of the universe? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461019"> @celtschk Mathematics is not a language. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461029"> @MakotoKato: I didn't say it is. I applied your *argument* to language, to demonstrate that it doesn't work. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461063"> @celtschk Mathematics is not a language. So I don't see why your argument demonstrates that my argument does not work. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461131"> @MakotoKato: Your argument was using the rule: "X turns out to be very useful, if not essential, for theories of physics, therefore X is somehow part of the universe." You applied that argument for "X=mathematics". I applied it for "X=language" and got an obviously wrong result, thus invalidating the rule. Since the rule is invalid, its application to mathematics is also invalid. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="462610"> @celtschk It's not just useful. It's indispensable. If you don't know much about quantum physics, I guess it's hard for you to understand this, though. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466012"> @MakotoKato: I'm a physicist working in quantum information, so I know quantum mechanics *quite* well. However, I'm also able to distinguish between the model of reality (Quantum mechanics) and reality itself. The success of quantum mechanics shows that there's something in nature which can be quite well mapped onto mathematical structures using complex numbers. That does *not* imply that there are complex numbers in nature (just as the fact that for centuries we've successfully mapped real objects onto locations and momenta which are exactly defined at the same time doesn't imply that … </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466013"> there are in nature any objects which indeed do have well-defined locations and momenta; indeed, according to quantum mechanics, they don't, and modern experiments agree with the quantum mechanica predictions). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466237"> @celtschk If the complex numbers(which were *discoverd* in 16th century) are just an idea like a story which one makes up freely, why is it used *essentially* to describe the fundamental law of the universe? Do you think it is an accident? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466260"> @celtschk Maybe the following link is of some use for you to understand what I'm talking about.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466263"> First: We *don't know* whether it is the fundamental law of the universe. It's the best we currently have. But then, classical mechanics was considered the fundamental laws for centuries, and today we know it isn't. Second: We use complex numbers for it because it turns out that they are *useful* in formulating the concepts which we use to model the universe. Note that we do *not* model the universe with complex numbers. We model the universe with operators and rays in Hilbert spaces. Now those Hilbert spaces are described with complex numbers. I don't know if the very same Hilbert spaces … </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466268"> could be described without complex numbers. However I know for sure that Hilbert spaces are not the only way to describe quantum mechanics (although I don't know enough about those alternative descriptions which have been developed to say whether they use complex numbers; but then, there are almost certainly others which we haven't yet found, and I see no reason to assume that all of them use complex numbers). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466306"> @celtschk Even if it is not the fundamental law of the universe, the fact that the Schrödinger equation describes and predicts pyhsical phenomena *very* accurately remains. I repeat my question. Do you think it(that the complex numbers are used essentially in the equation) is an accident? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="470922"> @MakotoKato: It might for example be an artefact of the fact that Lie groups are most easily worked with in their <span class="math-container" id="2298531" visual_id="5149872"><math alttext="GL(d,\mathbb{C})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>ℂ</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> representation. Also, if you look at the space of density matrices, they form a convex set in a *real* vector space (that's despite the density matrices are denoted by complex matrices). Unitary transformations translate into orthogonal transformations which keep that set invariant. And Hermitian operators are associated with linear function in that space. Who says that this real vector space is not more fundamental than the complex space of Hilbert space vectors? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471506"> @MakotoKato: Just another argument which just came to me: You know that the Schrödinger equation has complex solutions. However if you look at the gauge transformations of the electromagnetic field and how they affect the wave function, you'll notice that you can completely gauge away the complex phases, and then get a real wave function and a corresponding electromagnetic potential and vector potential (if there were already such potentials to begin with, they are modified accordingly). That way, you get a completely real (but more complicated) form of quantum mechanics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471554"> @celtschk Are you trying to say that complex numbers are not indispensable in physics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471570"> @MakotoKato: I can't tell for sure (for that, I'd have to know *much* more), but I definitely wouldn't exclude the possibility. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="472229"> @celtschk Do you agree with that complex numbers are indispensable in the Schrödinger equation? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="472940"> @MakotoKato: That depends very much on what you mean with "the Schrödinger equation". If you mean the equation exactly as normally formulated, then yes, because there's an explicit i in it. But that doesn't tell us much because nature doesn't care about which of many equivalent ways to formulate a theory we use. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="473861"> @celtschk Another example: Complex analytic manifolds called Calabi–Yau manifolds play an important role in physics. Do you still think that it is an accident that complex numbers are used in physics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="778691"> Incidentally, "imaginary" numbers have physical existence (w/o even using quantum theory). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1463401"> You only believe negative numbers "exist" because the idea has been presented to you since you were a small child and because you can see how naturally they fit in, i.e. even very simple math involving ones checking account might become "awkward" without them. But face it, you've never had negative one oranges in your hand or negative one of any physical object.  Imaginary numbers are only imaginary in that they are so-named and in that they require more complicated math to recognize how terribly awkward it is to close one's eyes and pretend they don't exist. Insofar as -5 exists so does 5i. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2184695"> @dustin Don't make gratuitious edits to old questions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2184698"> @MJD it wasn't gratuitous.

<p>The term "imaginary" is somewhat disingenuous. It's a real concept, with real (at least theoretical) application, just like all the "real" numbers.</p> <p>Think back to that algebra class. You were asked to solve a polynomial equation; that is, find all the values of X for which the entire equation evaluates to zero. You learned to do this by polynomial factoring, simplifying the equation into a series of first-power terms, and then it was easy to see that if any one of those terms evaluated to zero, then everything else, no matter its value, was multiplied by zero, producing zero.</p> <p>You tried this on a few quadratic equations.

We can now plug in the coefficients, and find the values of <span class="math-container" id="2298665" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> where <span class="math-container" id="2298666" visual_id="9872"><math alttext="ax^{2}+bx+c=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>.

Seems almost... circadian, rotational. As Clive N's answer so elegantly explains it, that's what imaginary numbers represent; a "rotation" of the graph through another plane, where the graph DOES cross the <span class="math-container" id="2298686" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span>-axis. Now, it's not actually really a circular rotation onto a new linear z-plane. Complex numbers have a real part, as you'd see by solving the quadratic equation for a polynomial with imaginary roots. We typically visualize these values in their own 2-dimensional plane, the complex plane. A quadratic equation with imaginary roots can thus be thought of as a graph in four dimensions; three real, one imaginary.</p> <p>Now, we call <span class="math-container" id="2298687" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> and any product of a real number and <span class="math-container" id="2298688" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> "imaginary", because what <span class="math-container" id="2298689" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> represents doesn't have an analog in our "everyday world".

This all generally simplifies to a quadratic equation, solvable by the quadratic formula. If the roots are imaginary, so are the breakeven points (and your expected profits).</p> <p>Another good one is in visualizations of complex numbers, and of their interactions when multiplied. The first one I was exposed to is a well-known series set, produced by taking an arbitrary complex number, squaring it (<span class="math-container" id="2298694" visual_id="5149905"><math alttext="(a+bi)^{2}=(a+bi)(a+bi)=a^{2}+2abi+b^{2}i^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}+2abi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>-</mo><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>), and then adding back its original value. Repeated to infinity with this number, the series either converges to zero or diverges to infinity (with a few starting numbers exhibiting periodicity; they'll jump around infinitely between a finite number of points much like <span class="math-container" id="2298695" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> itself does). The set of all complex numbers for which the series does not diverge is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a> or M-set, and while the area of the graph is finite, its perimeter is infinite, making the graph of this set a fractal (one of the most highly-studied, in fact). </p> <p>The Mandelbrot set can in turn be defined as the set of all complex numbers <span class="math-container" id="2298696" visual_id="146"><math alttext="c" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi></semantics></math></span> for which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_fractal">Julia set</a> <span class="math-container" id="2298697" visual_id="432797"><math alttext="J(f)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> of <span class="math-container" id="2298698" visual_id="5149906"><math alttext="f(z)=z^{2}+c\to z" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>→</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is connected. A Julia set exists for every complex polynomial function, but usually the most interesting and useful sets are the ones for values of <span class="math-container" id="2298699" visual_id="146"><math alttext="c" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi></semantics></math></span> that belong to the M-set; Julia fractals are produced much the same way as the M-set (by repeated iteration of the function to determine if a starting <span class="math-container" id="2298700" visual_id="44"><math alttext="z" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>z</mi></semantics></math></span> converges or diverges), but <span class="math-container" id="2298701" visual_id="146"><math alttext="c" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi></semantics></math></span> is constant for all points of the set instead of being the original point being tested. You can define Julia sets with all sorts of fractal shapes. These fractals, more accurately the iterative evaluation behind them, are used for pseudorandom number generation, computer graphics (the sets can be plotted in 3-d to create landscapes, or they can be used in shaders to define complex reflective properties of things like insect shells/wings), etc.</p>
