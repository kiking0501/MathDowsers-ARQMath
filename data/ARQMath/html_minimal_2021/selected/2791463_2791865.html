<p>In a first year engineering linear algebra class at my institution, the students learn about general linear transformations.  I understand that when working in general, understanding the general properties of a linear transformations is important.  However, the students in the class will, for the vast majority of the time, be working in <span class="math-container" id="25758051" visual_id="1662"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></semantics></math></span> where matrix representations of linear transformations are extremely well defined.  The students are often confused about the distinction between the transformation and its matrix representation.</p> <p>My question is this: presuming that the students will work in <span class="math-container" id="25758052" visual_id="1662"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></semantics></math></span> for their entire career with linear algebra, are there any properties of linear transformations that are more easily taught in general?  In other words, if we never even mentioned the term "linear transformation" and spoke only about matrices and matrix/vector algebra, what would be lost?</p>

(Also the derivative, the integral and linear time invariant filters are lineare operators that you do not express as a matrix). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5755962"> First, multiplication by a matrix **is** a linear transformation.  Second every linear transformation, from a finite dimensional space to a finite dimensional space, can be written as a matrix in given bases.  The "limitations" here are that the vector spaces must be finite dimensional and that we choose specific bases. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5755967"> All linear transformations can be represented by a matrix, and that doesn't stop at infinite dimensional linear transformations. But in infinite dimensions other representations, like integral operators, multiplication operators in function spaces becomes more useful. This happens because in some infinite-dimensional spaces, the linear space bases can be very large, while other types of bases can be more manageable. </td></tr>

<p><strong>Everything would be lost.</strong> Linear algebra would just be a mindless data shuffling. There would be no structural insight, nor the geometric intuition coming with it. Think of the so-called Levi-Civita calculus invented in the first half of the last century, with its screes of indices that were moved up and down without any understanding of what was going on. Or the idea of eigenspaces, Sylvester's theorem (important for engineers!), and on, and on.</p>
