ZPI comes from the German  phrase "Zerlegung in Primideale" = factorization in prime ideals.  The classical results on Dedekind domains were extended to rings  with zero divisors by S. Mori circa 1940, then later by K. Asano  and, more recently, by R. Gilmer.

Semigroup rings as Prufer rings.<br/> Duke Math. J. 41 (1974), 219--230.   </p> <hr/> <p>Let  RS  be the semigroup ring of a torsion-free cancellative abelian  semigroup  S  with zero over a commutative ring  R  with identity. The  semigroup operation on  S  is written as addition. Such rings  RS  may be  essentially thought of as generalizations of polynomial rings. The authors  seek conditions on  R  and  S  under which the semigroup ring  RS  will have  a given ring-theoretic property. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are  found for the ring  RS  to fall into one of four classes of rings: Prufer  rings, Bezout rings, almost Dedekind rings, and general ZPI-rings. The  investigations are closely related to (but independent of) another paper of  the authors [Michigan Math. J. 21 (1974), 65--86; MR 49#7381].  In Sections 2 and 3, the case of Prufer rings is considered. A Prufer ring is  a commutative ring  R  with identity such that each finitely generated regular  ideal of  R  is invertible. In order to state the main result of these two  sections, we need some more definitions: Let  Z, [Q]  be the additive group of  integers [rationals], and let  Z_0, [Q_0]  be the additive semigroup of  nonnegative integers [nonnegative rationals]. Semigroups of the form  G /\ Q_0,  where  G  is a subgroup of  Q  containing  Z , are called Prufer sub-semigroups  of Q_0. A commutative ring with identity in which each finitely generated ideal  is principal is a Bezout ring. It is shown that if RS is a Prufer ring then R  is (von Neumann) regular. Further, the authors prove the equivalence of the  following three conditions: (1) RS is a Prufer ring; (2) RS is a Bezout ring;  (3) R is a regular ring, and to within isomorphism S is either a Prufer  subsemigroup of Q_0 or a subgroup of Q containing Z .  In Section 4 the authors deal with almost Dedekind rings (AD-rings).  Following M. D. Larsen [J. Reine Angew. Math. 245 (1970), 119--123;  MR 42#7662], an AD-ring is a Prufer ring in which regular prime ideals are  maximal and not idempotent. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for   RS  to be an AD-ring are found in this section (Theorems 4.1 and 4.2).  In the final section (5), the notion of a general ZPI-ring is introduced.  These are commutative rings with identity in which each ideal is a  finite product of prime ideals. The following result (Theorem 5.1) is now  established. The semigroup ring  RS  is a general ZPI-ring if and only if  R  is a finite direct sum of fields and  S  is isomorphic to  Z_0  or to  Z .

An arithmetical  ring is a ring for which the ideals form a distributive lattice and a ZPI-ring  is one in which every ideal is a product of prime ideals.   </p> <p>The authors determine necessary and sufficient conditions on  R  and  S  that  the semigroup ring  R[S]  be arithmetical [respectively, semihereditary, a  ZPI-ring, a PIR (principal ideal ring)]. The main result is Theorem 3.6: Let   R  and  S  be as above and  G  the group of quotients of  S . Let  \rho  be a  congruence defined on  S  by  x\rho y  if and only if  x=y+f  for some   f in(S/\ tG) . Then  R[S]  is arithmetical if and only if one of the  following holds: (1) the torsion subgroup  tG  of  G  is a proper subsemigroup  of  S ,  R[tG]  is regular and the semigroup  S/\rho  of congruence classes of   \rho  is isomorphic to an additive subgroup of  Q  or the positive cone of  such a group, (2)  R  is arithmetical and  S=G  is a torsion group such that  if its  p -primary component  G_p !=  0  for some prime  p = Char}(R/M),  where  M  is a <em>maximal</em> ideal of  R , then  G_p  is cyclic or  quasicyclic and  R_M  is a field. Two other theorems, 4.1 and 4.2,  provide characterizations of  R[S]  that are ZPI-rings and PIRs.  This paper is closely related to the paper by R. Gilmer and T. Parker [Duke  Math. J. 41 (1974), 219--230; MR 49#5213], particularly the following  results (Corollary 3.1 and Corollary 5.1): If  R  and  S  are as above and  moreover  S  is torsion-free, then (a)  R[S]  is a Bezout ring if and only  if  R[S]  is a Prufer ring if and only if  R  is a (von Neumann) regular ring  and  S  is isomorphic to an additive subgroup of  Q  or the positive cone of  such a subgroup (the authors point out that each of the above statements is  also equivalent to another statement " R[S]  is arithmetical"), and (b)  R[S]  is a ZPI-ring if and only if  R[S]  is a PIR. Applying their theorems, the  authors give examples to show that the above results of Gilmer and Parker are  no longer true if the condition "S is torsion-free" is dropped.<br/>         Reviewed by Chin-Pi Lu </p> <hr/> <p>40 #1380  13.50<br/> Wood, Craig A.

Consider the cases (A)  R  has an identity,  (B)  R  has no identity, but has at least one proper prime ideal,  and  (C)  R has neither identity nor proper prime ideal.

The structure theorems,  which have been given in a less clear form by S. Mori [J. Sci. Hiroshima  Univ. Ser. A  10 (1940), 117--136; MR 2, 121], are as follows.

Various conditions on   R  are proved equivalent to its being Dedekind, among them the following: (1)  Every ideal in  R  is a product of prime ideals; (2) the zero ideal is a  product of prime ideals, and if a prime ideal  P  contains an ideal  A, then   P  is a factor of  A. In the presence of the ascending chain condition, the  following are also equivalent: (3) For every maximal ideal  M , there is no  ideal between  M  and  M^2 ; (4) the lattice of ideals is distributive. These  results generalize known conditions for an integral domain to be Dedekind.  [Rings satisfying (1) have been studied by S. Mori, J. Sci. Hirosima  Univ. Ser.

Thus rings without  unit element for multiplication and rings with divisors of zero are included in  the class of rings considered by the author. As a main result the author proves  that a ring R is a Z.P.I. ring if and only if (1) every ideal of R has a finite  basis, (2) for every pair of maximal prime ideals P, P' (that is, R/P, R/P' are  fields != 0) there is no ideal Q with PP' &lt; Q &lt; P, (3) there is no ideal Q with  R^2 &lt; Q &lt; R. (The three conditions are independent.) This theorem essentially  depends on the fact that in a Z.P.I. ring  P P_1 = P if P &lt; P_1 and if R/P is  not a field.  To prove the latter assertion it is necessary to investigate  the relationship between the ideal theory of R and R/P. Finally the author  formulates two theorems which are equivalent to his main theorem. For details  and the methods of proof see the original paper.<br/>         Reviewed by O. F. G.

Zbl. 23,102) characterized those commutative rings, in which  every ideal from the whole ring and different from the zero-ideal ideal can be  represented uniquely as product of finitely many prime ideals. The uniqueness  idea is so sharply calm? that look for the occurrence of redundant (simply  omitable), from the total ring different prime ideal factors to be excluded is.  On this condition one (with more easily addition of the results won by Kubo  themselves) receives the main clause: A commutative ring with unique prime  ideal decomposition is either an integral domain, to which the well-known  Noether five axioms apply, or a "primary, detachable ring", i.e. a ring  with unit element, which contains only one prime ideal at ideals \p and its  powers, whereby for a sufficiently large exponent \p^n = (0) becomes.  -- By a Z.P.I. ring the author understands a commutative ring, which needs  to be neither zero-divisor free nor contain unit element, and in which each  ideal can be represented as product of finitely many prime ideals; Uniqueness  of the representation is not demanded in contrast to the work by K. Kubo.  The idea of the Z.P.I. ring is thus as far calm? as at all possible. As main  results are emphasized: All Z.P.I. rings are O-rings, thus rings with maximum  condition (divisor chain set). -- An O-ring with unit element is then and a  Z.P.I. ring only if with no maximum ring prime ideal \p between \p and \p^2  a genuine intermediate ideal lies (the "Sono condition" characteristic of the  Japanese direction of the abstract ideal theory). -- The Z.P.I. rings with  unit element are nothing one but those already 1925 of W. Krull (S.-B.  Heidelberg. Akad. Wiss. 1925, 5. Abhandl.) in their structure exactly  described "multiplication rings with maximum condition".  -- A Ring \R without unit element is then a Z.P.I. ring only if it possesses  a direct decmomposition \R = \F + \m, whereby \F represents (possibly only  from the nullelement existing) a field, while \m is an O-ring without unit  element, which does not contain of (0) and \m different prime ideal, and in  which between \m and \m^2 a genuine intermediate ideal does not lie.<br/>         Krull (Bonn). </p>
