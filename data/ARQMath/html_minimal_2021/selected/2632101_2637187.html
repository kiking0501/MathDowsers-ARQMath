<div id="question" question_id="2632101">
<p>I'm interested in generalizing the underlying mechanism/theory/concept behind subtraction, from natural to negative numbers.</p> <p>Not tacking on a new concept just for handling the new cases, but applying the same  concept to both old and new cases (that in some sense already existed for the old cases). Perhaps identifying some property present for the old cases, and preserving it for the new cases.</p> <p>This is the farthest I've got:</p> <ol> <li>Natural numbers can be thought of as a physical objects: you can count how many there are, physically add more objects, or remove them (or take them away). But "take away" is not closed over the naturals; you can't physically take away more than you have.</li> </ol> <p>I say that "take away" <strong>cannot</strong> be generalized to negative numbers, because you cannot have a negative number of physical objects. However, we can look at it in a different way (a different theory, or concept or model), that gives the same answers for the same cases, but that <strong>can</strong> be generalized to negative numbers. [This is a kind of a cheat, but if the concept <em>is</em> present and active in the original case, I'll allow it.]</p> <ol start="2"> <li>We have a set of distinct elements, that are ordered, starting from one, and going on forever. We can go to the "next" one in this order (+1), and go to the previous one (-1). By repeating these, we can add a positive number, and subtract a positive number, and get the same results as above.</li> </ol> <p>But from the first element, we can't go to a previous one. It seems a very natural and logical extension to allow this - it seems more like removing an artificial barrier than introducing a new concept.</p> <p>If we allow this, we have negative numbers, and, given a positive or negative number, we can subtract a positive number <span class="math-container" id="24332855" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span>, by going to the previous element, <span class="math-container" id="24332856" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> times. There's also nice a nice symmetry, with both ends being infinite, instead of only one.</p> <p>Although an improvement, this still isn't closed on this expanded set of numbers (positive and negative), because we can't subtract a negative.</p> <p>I say that we <strong>cannot</strong> generalize or extend this mechanism/theory to subtraction of negative numbers, because doing something a negative number of times doesn't make any sense. However,  we can again change the figure, and use a a different theory or model which <strong>can</strong> be generalized in this way. We do this by observing properties in the previous case, and choosing a new model that selectively preserves those properties when it is generalized.</p> <ol start="3"> <li><p>A different way of thinking about "going back" <span class="math-container" id="24332857" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> times to get to the result, or of "taking away" is the <em>difference</em> between two numbers,  how many next or previous steps it takes to move from second to the first. We might get to this idea in two steps:</p> <ol> <li>the "going back" <span class="math-container" id="24332858" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> steps is the difference between the starting number and result</li> <li>it turns out that if we start from the same number, but instead go back by the result number of steps, we get <span class="math-container" id="24332859" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span>. i.e. in algebraic notation, with <span class="math-container" id="24332860" visual_id="296038"><math alttext="S,R" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> for start and result: <span class="math-container" id="24332861" visual_id="4025369"><math alttext="S-n=R\iff S-R=n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>⇔</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span></li> </ol></li> </ol> <p>This is quite a different concept, but it does generalize smoothly to any pair of numbers, because they all are separated by some number of steps on the ordered elements. It builds on the generalization of positive to negative, and the property that they can both be moved along in steps.</p> <p>It also changes the role of the operands: instead of one being an instruction (to move left or right), both operands have equal status, and the result is the relationship between them. This, again, has symmetry.</p> <p>By this model, from any number (positive or negative) can be taken away or subtracted any other number (positive or negative).</p> <p>To recap, the steps were:</p> <ul> <li><p>extend numbers to negatives (see as "next" and "previous", and "previous" continues past <span class="math-container" id="24332862" visual_id="92"><math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>0</mn></semantics></math></span>)</p></li> <li><p>extend subtraction to negatives (see "take away" as "difference", and "difference" applies between any two numbers).</p></li> </ul> <p>I think this completes the concept of negative numbers.</p> <p>But there's another step, to algebraic notation, which has the same properties, but which is different altogether, in that there is no theory or model. It is a purely syntactic system - there is no coherent concept. Just a system of rules. What is most striking to me is that the rules for addition seem overly complex, compared to the above simple and logical model. [Though to anyone proficient in arithmetic, who has internalized the rules, this claim of complexity might be unbelievable].</p> <p>By Occam's Razor, it is troubling that an unnecessarily complex model is true, that a series of specific cases could he correct. But, unlike the famously complex approximation of "epicycles within epicycles", it is precisely correct.</p>

If it keeps getting more complex, it never will. (Or, is school-taught maths an over-simplification, so going deeper gets more complicated before it gets simpler?) Also, if Euclid has simple axoims, shouldn't there be simple axoims for arithmetic? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435391"> Not sure whether this will be enough, but have you looked at the [Formal construction section of the Wikipedia article on negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number#Formal_construction_of_negative_integers)?  The basic idea is to make sense of differences <span class="math-container" id="24332870" visual_id="35808"><math alttext="a-b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> when <span class="math-container" id="24332871" visual_id="141067"><math alttext="b&gt;a" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> by defining and investigating the properties of certain equivalence classes of ordered pairs <span class="math-container" id="24332872" visual_id="2239"><math alttext="(a,b)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435420"> @WillOrrick Thanks. I've seen this idea. I can see that it's true; and that it defines <span class="math-container" id="24332915" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> properties by a construction that only use natural numbers and operations... in a sense, that's "extending" one from the other, but I don't see that it's generalizing one from the other. I probably need a detailed, step-by-step account of how each common part corresponds to the analogous part in the other, justifying why they are analogous, and then showing/justifying how the extra features of <span class="math-container" id="24332915" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> are a generalization. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435665"> @bof The book you recommend is interesting in its own way for its very fundamental analysis, but I wouldn't say it treats what the OP wanted. In any case +1. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435667"> @hyperpallium Perhaps you should consider ElfHog's suggestion below. There are many ways to view the same thing. You may forget about subtraction as an operation, instead define the negative numbers and analyse the addition of additive inverses. See if it helps. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435669"> @Allawonder It starts from basic axioms, and proceeds step by step without skipping any details. And the development includes subtraction of positive and negative real numbers. And if he wants, he can **start** at the beginning of Chapter IV, with positive reals already established, and see how negative numbers and operations on them are introduced. What else did the OP want??? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435674"> I glanced through it, and you're right. I had meant that it did not treat subtraction as an operation as the OP wanted (it did this, so far as I am aware, for the complex numbers). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435902"> @bof Landau is incredibly tedious - perfect for me! And google shpws it's an authoritative text. Reassuringly, [my approach](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2624416/why-does-subtraction-work-over-mathbbz-i-e-pos-and-neg) had similarities, using abs value <span class="math-container" id="24332875" visual_id="16213"><math alttext="||" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span>, and going case-by-case. But, both are complicated! I guess that's just how it is. Finally, he rigourously defines subtraction, but doesn't argue for how subtraction of negatives is analogous to subtraction of positives - that's what I meant by "generalize". (he doesn't define subtraction for postives, so can't make the analogy). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5435916"> @bof BTW there is a little dependency on previous chapters: he uses lowercase greek letters for "cuts", which are positive, but it's not mentioned in IV itself. I don't think there are other dependencies (but there could be). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5441464"> Thanks @yh016, I'll have a look. It's been a while since I had a teacher of this, I just used the `algebra-precalculus` tag because the description seemed close. By "good explanation"  I assume you mean the KA one I linked. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5441522"> @yh016 I guess you refer to `2.1.1 Algebraic Properties of R` pp.24-25 (40,41 in the pdf) in 4th ed? I searched for "negatives", and that seemed closest. These define, but not show a generalization or extension from natural subtraction over natural numbers. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5441527"> [Also, an aside: since several things(?) can satisfy these properties, isn't it true that they aren't enough to pin down the specific thing (e.g. reals), but a more abstract concept, that enables algebraic manipulation? Sure, anything else that satisfies these is *isomorphic* to reals... but only in terms of these properties. For example, <span class="math-container" id="24332890" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="24332877" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℚ</mi></semantics></math></span> also satisfy them. Anyway, I'm interested in negatives... but it's not clear to me that they are enough to pin down <span class="math-container" id="24332890" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> as numbers either, since they aren't enough to pin down reals...] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5441833"> @hyper Algebraic properties of numbers are very well understood. In particular, we *define* different number systems abstractly rather than try to find them in reality. It is then easy to derive, rigorously, in extremely large generality (as in, not just for numbers, but for any associative, commutative operation with inverses) that <span class="math-container" id="24332879" visual_id="298733"><math alttext="-(-x)=x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5441843"> Strictly speaking, real numbers don't exist. There are real numbers that cannot be computed to arbitrary precision by any computer program, no matter how long it runs. Those numbers may as well not exist. So mathematics and reality diverged centuries ago and the two now have only coincidental relation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442166"> @MattSamuel That makes sense (that the advantage of algenraic properties is that they make it easier to prove things rigourously, and that they generalize to other systems that have the same properties). But I take exception to saying it "defines" a number system. If Z, Q and R are different, but have identical algebraic properties, how can those properties be said to define them? (or are there extra properties that distingiish them?) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442176"> I agree they don't exist. Actually,mI think negatives, rationals, reals and complex numbers don't exist - standard notation suggets this, but not stating the,, but describing how to compute them. e.g. <span class="math-container" id="24332880" visual_id="4025371"><math alttext="-1,1/3,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt><mo>,</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span>. "-1" is an expression, a unary operator and a positive. The suprising thing is how useful they are. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442180"> There are extra properties. You start with natural numbers. Integers come by allowing additive inverses. Rationals cone from allowing division. Then passing to the real numbers is not at all algebraically motivated. It is the topological completion of the rational numbers, what you get when you assert that all Cauchy sequences converge. But then passing to the complex numbers is so that we get an algebraically closed field. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442213"> @MattSamuel I don't understand those last two, but if they aren't algebraic properties, then R and C can't be said to be *defined* by algebraic properties - I think? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442222"> It depends what you mean by that. In a sense, very few structures are determined solely by their algebraic properties. Usually there are many fundamentally different structures with the same basic properties. So the properties become a tool, but they are not all you have to work with. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5442224"> You could say the whole basis of algebraic geometry is studying algebraic structures with addition that is commutative and associative with inverses, multiplication that is commutative and associative with identity, such that the multiplication distributes over addition. But that's like saying number theory is the study of strings of digits that terminate. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5444616"> @MattSamuel Thanks. I though if algebraic properties alone are enough to define (e.g.) numeric addition? i.e. if a system has the same algebraic property as addition over naturals, then there's always a mapping from naturals to that system's elements via which you can do addition? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5444629"> The system has to have at least as many elements (so, infinite for naturals). I saw a mapping to multiplication of naturals, <span class="math-container" id="24332881" visual_id="30956"><math alttext="2^{x}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msup></semantics></math></span>, because <span class="math-container" id="24332882" visual_id="4025372"><math alttext="2^{i}2^{j}=2^{i+j}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>i</mi></msup><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>j</mi></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span>, you can do addition with multiplication. (even the identities match up: <span class="math-container" id="24332883" visual_id="43101"><math alttext="2^{0}=1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>0</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>). But it wouldn't work for a sort of "degenerate" system, where every operation gave the same result. Also, I think there's no mapping to do (eg) modulo 10 arithmetic in modulo 12 arithmetic. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5444630"> Anyway, if something like that was possible, (a) it would be amazing (b) I would accept that algebraic properties, in some strange way, "define" arithmetic. [It might be better if I ask this as question in itself] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5469921"> Who is pressuring you that you have to post an incomplete question? (Yes, having a "to be continued" means it is incomplete.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5469934"> @AsafKaragila Thanks. It was my attempt to answer it, which I've now moved to an answer. </td></tr>

Needless to say, in the general case there is more going on than merely adding the negatives; for instance, some elements that were distinct in <span class="math-container" id="24332912" visual_id="4"><math alttext="M" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>M</mi></semantics></math></span> may become identified in <span class="math-container" id="24332913" visual_id="673"><math alttext="G" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>G</mi></semantics></math></span>.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="5447780"> Thanks. "Groping toward" is apt. Understanding this "Grothendieck group construction" seems to require more group theory than I currently have. (I don't understand even its significance from the wiki link ) - could you recommend a less technical introduction? I acknowledge that might not be possible. Also, it doesn't seem to involve a generalization **from** subtraction of positives **to** subtraction of negatives, in that it doesn't start from the former. (But it may be just that I don't understand it). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5448732"> I tried to address your concern in my *answer* that I just edited. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5451470"> Thanks! I should clarify that I mean a mechanism or theory that was already present in the natural numbers and their subtraction. I think Group theory has its own mechanisms and "theory", so I'm not sure it can answer such a question... However, I still don't understand the Grothendieck construction to see for myself whether it does do what I mean, and how. Maybe it does! BTW you said my "comment", but quoted from my question - since I also discussed it in the comments, I wonder if that's the context you were answering from? I ask because it does seem more related to those comments, to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5452083"> The natural numbers <span class="math-container" id="24332914" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span> are the simplest example of a semigroup, and the Grothendieck construction applied to them produces the group <span class="math-container" id="24332915" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> which is the infinite cyclic group. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5454232"> Thanks, that gives me some idea. BTW I meant a mechanism like counting physical objects, physically adding and literally taking away. Viewing <span class="math-container" id="24332916" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span> as a semigroup already views them in terms of group theory, so perhaps not surprising it generalizes to other concepts in group theory. However, it's an interesting generalization - and maybe it does do what I want. I will keep it in mind for when I have the requisite background. Thanks again. </td></tr>
