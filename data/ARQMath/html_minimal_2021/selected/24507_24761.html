<p>Though I've understood the logic behind's Russell's paradox for long enough, I have to admit I've never really understood why mathematicians and mathematical historians thought it so important.  Most of them mark its formulation as an epochal moment in mathematics, it seems to me.  To my uneducated self, Russell's paradox seems almost like a trick question, like a child asking what the largest organism on Earth is, and getting back an answer talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria_solidipes">a giant fungus.</a> </p> <p>"<em>Well, OK</em>..."</p> <p>The set of all sets admits all sorts of unmathematical objects right? Chickens, spoons, 2 <span class="math-container" id="244199" visual_id="9946"><math alttext="\times" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>×</mo></semantics></math></span> 4s, what have you...I can't imagine a situation where a mathematician solving a concrete problem would invoke a set like that.  The typical sets one sees in everyday mathematics are pretty well defined and limited in scope: <span class="math-container" id="244200" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="244201" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="244202" visual_id="1492"><math alttext="\mathbb{C}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℂ</mi></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="244203" visual_id="8293529"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathbb{Q}_{p}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>ℚ</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></semantics></math></span>, subsets of those things.  They are all built off each other in a nice way.</p> <p>But clearly important people think the result significant.  It prompted Gottlob Frege, a smart and accomplished man, who Wikipedia tells me extended the study of logic in non-trivial ways, to say that the "foundations of [his] edifice were shaken."  So I suppose Russell's paradox is "deep" somehow?  Is there a practical example in mathematics that showcases this, where one might be led horribly astray if one doesn't place certain restrictions on sets, in say, dealing with PDEs, elliptic curves, functional equations?  Why isn't Russell's paradox just a "gotcha"?</p>

<tr><td comment_id="52838"> I think the problem was that the set-theory back then allowed the existence of a set of all sets that did not contain itself, in the way that it did. And it obviously makes an inconcistency in the (naive) theory of sets. I am not sure about any direct practical significance this has, but it is not a good starting point for a mathematical theory. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="52840"> Russell's paradox highlighted the problem with unfettered Comprehension. Frege was trying to develop a logical system that required him to consider a kind of unrestricted comprehension, and Russell's example shows that the issue is with comprehension. But the idea is actually very clever: it lies behind the proof that given a set <span class="math-container" id="244204" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> there is always <span class="math-container" id="244205" visual_id="160911"><math alttext="B\notin A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>∉</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, and to some extent behind the proof of Cantor's Theorem that no set can be bijected with its power set. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="52846"> By the way, we *still do* take Russell's Paradox seriously, or at least most of us do.  Sometimes you encounter passages like "we ignore set-theoretic difficulties" in math books and papers, but in my opinion this translates to "We can't be bothered to say only things that are completely correct.  We are hoping that you are either so unsophisticated as not to notice or so sophisticated as to be able to fix what we've said more easily than we could."  I.e., it is somewhere between lazy and irresponsible. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="52896"> I'd mildly disagree with Pete, in that ignoring set-theoretic issues doesn't have to be laziness or irresponsibility.  It could mean the author thinks the exposition is deemed easier to digest when one ignores such issues -- there's perhaps a small implication that filling in such details isn't difficult so it's a tolerable lack of formality for what is seen as an expositional benefit.  It's much like how all written proofs in journals are not formal proofs, but just enough details so that one could fill in a formal proof using twenty times the number of characters. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="52924"> @Ryan: choosing to elide details is often a good expository choice.  But "we ignore set-theoretic difficulties" doesn't mean (or so I had intended) leaving out details.  It means that pretending that certain things are true when they actually are not.  In my opinion, it is somewhat irresponsible to do that for any reason.  And I think that some people who write in this way believe in principle that "getting it right" is just a fussy nuisance, but years of doing such ignoring have given them poor intuition about what is easily fixable... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="52925"> For instance, I have seen in a lecture someone attempt to take a direct sum indexed over all abelian groups (in a situation where it was not clear that any of the objects needed to be zero).  I sort of cleared my throat and explained that that just didn't make any sense to me, and the speaker did not in fact know how to correct himself (or even really understand what the problem was).  That's lazy or irresponsible, IMO. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53139"> @Arturo Magidin: Despite what's already been said, I agree with the intent of the title question...shouldn't people have responded immediately 'Yes, of course that's a contradiction, so that means the described set (the set of all sets) just doesn't exist' (and so no need to worry further) ? There's no contradiction in -math-, just a contradiction in that particular statement. Yes, so comprehension can't be applied successfully arbitrarily, but that doesn't mean 'math' falls apart. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53161"> @Mitch: First, the very notion that there was such a thing as a set that could not exist was **entirely new**; up to then, with unlimited comprehension, the idea was that *anything* could be a set. So in fact, Russell's paradox introduces an entirely new idea: that there are sets that just plain don't exist. You say, "fine, then let's move on". Okay, but the problem is that there was a lot of work that had been done or was ongoing, in which sets were used *without* checking if the thing described actually existed or not (cont...) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53162"> @Mitch: (cont...) So, since there are some things we can describe but which turn out to *not* be sets, then anything that was done without worrying about whether they were sets or not has to be reviewed and checked. Dedekind's construction of the real numbers as Dedekind cuts... oops, need to check if those things exist or not; Ideals and modules in algebraic number theory... oops, need to check if those things exist or not; geometry arguments that talk about "all points" or things like that... oops, need to check if they actually exist or not. (cont...) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53163"> @Mitch (cont...) Finally: remember the context. Some people were actively worried about the fact that arguments were leading to antinomies and contradictions, and there was an active attempt to clean up the foundations. Because a lot of *math* was built on arguments that involved ideas closely related to sets, all those arguments needed to be checked. Just because the Russell sets seems unnatural does not mean that "natural-looking sets" will be okay. (Goedel's sentence is unnatural, but there are "natural looking" sentences that are formally undecidable). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53271"> @Mitch (I wonder if, when we get to three long comments, I shouldn't just post a community wiki answer instead...) This reminds me of a quote; it describes a castle on a cliff where, after every great storm, the spiders rush to rebuild their torn spiderwebs, afraid that if they don't the entire castle will fall down. The quote is taken from a book on the logical foundations of mathematics... It's likely that to most working mathematicians, Russell's paradox was ignored much like the problems with infinitesimals in calculus were; but for those who were interested in foundations, it was big. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53284"> @Arturo Magidin It's not too late!  This question is just begging for the expansive tour-de-force type answer you've become known for -- that's partly why I left it open ;-) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53303"> @Billare: Ah, flattery will get you everywhere. Anyway, I've repeated some of the stuff above, and added some other personal impressions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="55546"> See also this MathOverflow answer: http://mathoverflow.net/questions/18659/set-theory-in-practice </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2316166"> Apparently I do not have *50 reputation* to be allowed to add a meta-comment. But I would like to say that I agree with Arturo Magidin and that I found a similar quote about the metaphor of the spiders on a review by Martin Davis about some book of mathematical logic. *On the banks of the Rhine a beautiful castle had been standing for centuries. In the cellar of the castle an intricate network of webbing had been constructed by the industrious spiders who lived there. One day a great wind sprang up and destroyed the webs. Frantically the spiders worked to repair the damage. For you see, they t </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3950785"> I'm not sure if this has been mentioned, but there is also the fact that in classical logic -- the logic that most mathematicians use, knowingly or not -- we have the principle of explosion: from a contradiction, we can deduce anything. So if we admit the Russell set and Russell's paradox, how do we know that any theorems we've proven aren't just <span class="math-container" id="244206" visual_id="8293530"><math alttext="r\in r\land r\notin r\vdash P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>∈</mo><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>∧</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow><mo>∉</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow><mo>⊢</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> in disguise. </td></tr>

<div answer_id="24761" id="answer">
<p>My dad likes to tell of a quotation he once read in a book on philosophy of mathematics. He does not remember which book it was, and I have never tried to track it down; this is really hearsay to the fourth degree, so it may not even be true. But I think it is pretty apt. The quote describes a castle on a cliff where, after each a storm finally dies down, the spiders come out andrun around frantically rebuilding their spiderwebs, afraid that if they don't get them up quickly enough the castle will fall down. </p> <p>The interesting thing about the quote was that it was attributed to a book on the logical foundations of mathematics.</p> <p>First, note that you are looking at the problem from a perspective of someone who "grew up" with sets that were, in some way, <em>carefully</em> "built off each other in a nice way." This was not always the case. Mathematicians were not always very careful with their foundations: and when they started working with infinite sets/collections, they <em>were</em> not being particularly careful. Dedekind does not start from the Axiom of Infinity to construct the naturals and eventually get to the reals; and moreover, when he gives his construction it is precisely to try to answer the question of just what <em>is</em> a real number! </p> <p>In some ways, Russell's paradox was a storm that sent the spiders running around to reconstruct the spiderwebs.  Mathematicians hadn't been working with infinite collections/sets for very long, at least not as "completed infinities". The work of Dedekind on the reals, and even on algebraic number theory with the definitions of ideals and modules, was not without its critics. </p> <p><em>Some</em> mathematicians had become interested in the issues of foundations; one such mathematician was Hilbert, both through his work on the Dirichlet Principle (justifying the work of Riemann), and his work on Geometry (with the problems that had become so glaring in the "unspoken assumptions" of Euclid). Hilbert was such a towering figure at the time that his interest was itself interesting, of course, but there weren't that many mathematicians working on the foundations of mathematics.</p> <p>I would think like Sebastian, that most "working mathematicians" didn't worry too much about Russell's paradox; much like they didn't worry too much about the fact that Calculus was not, originally, on solid logical foundation. Mathematics clearly <em>worked</em>, and the occasional antinomy or paradox was likely not a matter of interest or concern.</p> <p>On the other hand, the 19th century had highlighted a <em>lot</em> of issues with mathematics. During this century all sorts of tacit assumptions that mathematicians had been making had been exploded. Turns out, functions can be <em>very</em> discontinuous, not just at a few isolated points; they can be continuous but not differentiable everywhere; you can have a curve that fills up a square; the Dirichlet Principle need not hold; there are geometries where there are no parallels, and geometries where there are an infinite number of parallels to a given line and through a point outside of it; etc. While it was clear that mathematics <em>worked</em>, there was a general "feeling" that it would be a good idea to clear up these issues.</p> <p>So some people began to study foundations specifically, and try to build a solid foundation (perhaps like Weierstrass had given a solid foundation to calculus). Frege was one such.</p> <p>And to people who were very interested in logic and foundations, like Frege, Russell's paradox it <em>was</em> a big deal because it pinpointed that one particular tool that was very widely used led to serious problems. This tool was unrestricted comprehension: any "collection" you can name was an object that could be manipulated and played with.</p> <p>You might say, "well, but Russell's paradox arises in a very artificial context, it would never show up with a "real" mathematical collection." But then, one might say that functions that are continuous everywhere and nowhere differentiable are "very artificial, and would never show up in a 'real' mathematical problem". True: but it means that certain results that had been taken for granted no longer can be taken for granted, and need to be restricted, checked, or justified anew, if you want to claim that the argument is valid.</p> <p>In context, Russell's paradox showed an entirely new thing: there can be collections that are not sets, that are not objects that can be dealt with mathematically. This is a very big deal if you don't even have that concept to begin with! Think about finding out that a "function" doesn't have to be "essentially continuous" and can be an utter mess: an entirely new concept or idea; and entirely new possibility that has to be taken into account when thinking about functions. So with Russell's, an entirely new idea that needs to be taken into account when thinking about collections and sets. All the work that had been done before which tacitly assumed that just because you could name a collection it was an object that could be mathematically manipulated was now, in some sense, "up in the air" (as much as those castle walls are "up in the air" until the spiders rebuild their webs, perhaps, or perhaps more so). </p> <p>If nothing else, Russell's paradox creates an entirely new category of things that did not exist before: <strong>not-sets</strong>. Now you think, "oh, piffle; I could have told them that", but that's because you grew up in a mathematical world where the notion that there are such things as "not-sets" is taken for granted. At the time, it was the exact opposite that was taken for granted, and Russell's paradox essentially tells everyone that something they all thought was true just isn't true. Today we are so used to idea that it seems like an observation that is not worth that much, but that's because we grew up in a world that already knew it.  </p> <p>I would say that Russell's paradox was a big deal and wasn't a big deal. It was a big deal for anyone who was concerned with foundations, because it said "you need to go further back: you need to figure out what <em>is</em> and what is <em>not</em> a collection you can work with." It undermined all of Frege's attempt at setting up a foundation for mathematics (which is why Frege found it so important: he certainly had invested a lot of himself into efforts that were not only cast into doubt, but were essentially demolished before they got off the ground). It was such a big deal that it completely infuses our worldview today, when we simply <em>take for granted</em> that some things are not sets.</p> <p>On the other hand, it did not have a major impact on things like calculus of variations, differential equations, etc., because those fields do not really rely very heavily on their foundations, but only on the properties of the objects they are working with; just like most people don't care about the Kuratowski definition of an ordered pair; it's kind of nice to know it's there, but most will treat the ordered pair as a black box. I would expect most of them to think "Oh, okay; get back to me when you sort that out." Perhaps like the servants living on the castle not worrying too much about whether the spiders are done building their webs or not. Also, much like the way that after Weierstrass introduced the notion of <span class="math-container" id="244209" visual_id="46"><math alttext="\epsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ϵ</mi></semantics></math></span>-<span class="math-container" id="244210" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span> definitions and limits into calculus, and then re-established what everyone was using <em>anyway</em> when they were using calculus, it had little impact in terms of applications of calculus.</p> <p>That rambles a bit, perhaps. And I'm not a very learned student of history, so my impressions may be off anyway.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="53433"> Excellent...thanks for expositing...that was my main concern, that I was having 20-20 hindsight, unaware of the conditions of thought at the time. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53435"> But I take issue with the metaphor, in that it connotes that foundations are -totally- useless. Practically, it's easy to see that bridges are staying up (mostly) without them (the Babylonians did <span class="math-container" id="570717">O</span>K with mostly unproven facts, not needing the foundations of Euclid's axiom system). But one characteristic of modern mathematics is discovering the foundations under the foundations, at every level.

I suspect that if I were to manage to track it down it would end up being very much tongue-in-cheek. But it's true that for most people who *use* math foundations are about as much interest as scaffolding on buildings that have been completed. Nice to know they were there, but the fact that the building is shelter from the storm and does not appear to be falling down is all that matters, (even if the architect is very worried about that crack in wall of the basement). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53574"> @Arturo Magidin You answer was as wonderful as I expected, thank you for it.  But I disagree with a couple of things you write, like: "one might say that functions that are continuous everywhere and nowhere differentiable are 'very artificial'..."  Don't these sort of functions arise in infinite sums of Fourier series, a field that was birthed from its applications to engineering?  I think I was not very clear in what I was trying to say: I'm well aware that strange exceptions can lead to interesting mathematics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53581"> @Billare:The point I was trying to make is that if you think about functions the way, say, Euler thought about functions, then everywhere continuous-nowhere differentiable functions will look artificial (remember also that Fourier's work was not initially accepted as valid, and it took some effort to get it to be accepted). Such functions look artificial if you have that point of view. Or, the characteristic function of the rationals: it's obvious once you see it, and once you accept the very general definition of function, but if you think of functions as "curves", it seems artificial. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53582"> @Arturo Magidin (cont'd) But the common "set of all sets" story that is often used to relate Russell's paradox didn't appear that way to me, because it admitted unmathematical objects. What gave me substantial insight was Asaf's answer: The essential quality to pull away from the oft-told story is that one has to _check_, and not just assume that a collection of objects satisfies a formula. And, from another answer, I understand what distinguishes the "set of all sets" as pathological its self-referential nature; such sets might naturally arise in more interesting mathematical venues. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53598"> @Billare: Yes: the "big deal" was that Russell pointed out that there are things that are not "sets", and entirely new category of things, so to speak. (Since Asaf's answer gave you substantial insight, perhaps that should be the accepted answer? Mine is more of a ramble). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="53600"> @Arturo Magidin I debated which answer to accept for like an hour: Different individual posts gave me good insights, but were at the same time limited; yours came later, but collated everything important.  A conundrum! I ultimately decided I wanted yours on top, for  the benefit of future readers.  But as you wish... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="54441"> Arturo, I have heard the spider story in colloquium talks by Leo Harrington, the Berkeley logician. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="54604"> @JDH: Interesting; thanks Joel! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="273106"> Morris Kline also uses the spider metaphor in _Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty_ </td></tr>
