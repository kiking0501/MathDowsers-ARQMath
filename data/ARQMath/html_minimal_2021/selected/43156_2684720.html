<tr><td comment_id="96126"> What is your background?  What makes you think that you are unable to tackle 'Concrete Mathematics' currently?  Was there anything in particular in the book that seemed mysterious? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96128"> Mr. Knuth said it on the beginning, so if author expresses it himself, majority spreads rumor :) My background is that I'm CS student in software engineering very interested in compilers, low level programming and skill improvement, so here it is where TAOCP and other stuff takes place. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96151"> I think you will need to know some basic calculus (Spivak's book is my favorite, but I'm not sure it's good for beginners...) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96218"> Apostol’s *Calculus* is also an excellent book. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96228"> @Gadi, emphasis on "some basic". The first hour of a lecture course on calculus is probably more than sufficient given how little of Concrete Mathematics is about continuous functions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96239"> I read the book in Class 11 or 12 (i.e., before college). Of course there were some parts of it I didn't understand at the time, and I just skipped them, but on the whole it's pretty self-contained. Just make sure you do as many exercises as you can. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96242"> @Peter, I think a basic knowledge of limits is required in order to avoid running in screams when they shove it in your face. I also don't believe that limits can be understood in one hour of calculus. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="96261"> TAOCP first or prep for it with CM before? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2219048"> I'm 11 years old and reading Concrete Mathematics, with just algebra 2/basic precalc under my belt. I just started today and take thorough notes. I really think with dedication a large part of the book SHOULD be doable, and you could always skip some of the calculus parts! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2733382"> You must be good in basics of calculus. Otherwise basic arithmetic is fine. Nevertheless, the book is terribly hard, despite informal style suggests otherwise. I would say that it is most likely prohibitevly hard even if you are a master in Computer Engeneering, like me. The problem is that all derivations involve a lot of unexplained shortcuts. That is the learning curve is too steep and you need a "companion" book that would explain all the magical Knuth derivations rather than prerequisite books, See also http://rs.io/hard-books-overrated. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2735713"> Just to bring an example. Knuth says for instance that <span class="math-container" id="450050" visual_id="1773544"><math alttext="\floor{x/3}+\floor{x+2\over 3}=\floor{x}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><merror class="ltx_ERROR undefined undefined"><mtext>\floor</mtext></merror><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><merror class="ltx_ERROR undefined undefined"><mtext>\floor</mtext></merror><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mn>3</mn></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><merror class="ltx_ERROR undefined undefined"><mtext>\floor</mtext></merror><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> in one derivation, after discussing the ceiling function basic properties. Probably, the former follows from the basic properties, but I do not "see" it. I do not know how many days I need to loose on this simple obstacle. You may also read about `Repertoire Method` from Chapter 1. So, preliminaries won't help you. They don't work if teacher starts with trivialities and yet feeds you with undigestably large steps. Hardly you can have smooth learning if you cannot take even single of them. </td></tr>

<p>It's never late to add an answer. Especially if it serves as reference to others. I'm a double major (senior) in CS and math. Compared to a common CS student my math knowledge is far superior, especially after taking courses in abstract algebra, real analysis, and so on that really changed my way of thinking, even more when it comes to write proofs. However, even with all these I must say that Concrete Mathematics is a tough reading. Sometimes I find myself looking at some answers in the back, because honestly it's hard material. Even though the authors, especially Knuth, are acclaimed experts, that does not mean they make the best teachers. People sometimes lie when they say it was not that hard just to seem smart. Do not believe them. The authors assume too much from the readers to be honest. You will struggle, but you will learn. If you don't know about a concept search the definition somewhere else, compare it to the one in the book if there's any. You will forget many things momentarily but in the long run they'll be there, and when the moment comes you will remember you saw it in a book, you will review it and you will apply it. That's all you need.</p>
