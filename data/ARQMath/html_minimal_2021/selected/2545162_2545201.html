<p>After having a disagreement with my teacher I posted the following question a few days ago and I have now rewritten my proof with all the comments I received earlier in mind. Would anyone like to comment if anything is still missing or if it looks good?</p> <p>Q: Let a and b be integers such that gcd(a,b)=1 and let c be a third integer. Show that if a|bc then a|c.</p> <p>(Note: I am aware that there are other and better proofs such as from Bezouts identity, but still like to know if the one I came up with was valid)</p> <p>Proof: Any integer that divides another integer is also a factor of that integer. Since a|bc, a is a factor of bc and all the factors of a are factors of bc. Therefore, one and only one of three options holds true for factors &gt;1; either some of the factors of a are factors of b and some of c, or all of the factors of a are factors of b and none of c, or similarly all of the factors of a are factors of c and none of b. In the trivial case that a=1, a|c because 1 divides any integer, and if b=1 then bc=c and we know that a|bc. Considering that gcd(a,b)=1, a and b have no common factors (except number 1), so the first option above can not be true. For the same reason, neither can the second option be valid. We can now conclude that the third option must be the correct one; all of the factors of a are factors of c and none of b (except number 1). This means that because a is itself one of the factors of a, a must be a factor to c, and so a|c.</p> <p>Short version: all factors of a are factors of bc (a|bc) a and b have no common factors except number 1 (gcd(a,b)=1) all factors of a must then be factors to c and therefore a|c</p>

If you have, then you can but I think it'd be easier and clearer to talk of prime factors. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5254638"> @fleablood to answers your first comment, the reason is because as stated "all factors of a are factors of bc".

If some factors of a are factors of neither b or c how could they be factors of bc? So the options where supposed to be stated in the context of the premiss mentioned above, but maybe I didnt get it right. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5254810"> Try to describe the cases clearly and in detail; I think you'll hit a problem.  Read the article on Hilbert Numbers I linked to earlier.  That describes a simple situation in which most of the rules of arithmetic still hold, but unique factorization fails (more to the point, the claim you are trying to prove fails). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5372202"> @Lukas Please, if you are ok, you can accept the answer and set it as solved.

<p>In my opinion your proof is correct as it is essentially based on the Foundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.</p> <p>In a way, the proof via Bezout's Theorem is more basic, in the sense that it is used in the proof of the FTA.</p> <p>Finally Bezout's Theorem can be proved by Euclidean Algorithm which is the starting point of all of these important results.</p>
