<tr><td comment_id="5084979"> If you don't truly know if the the proposition Q is true, maybe you shouldn't be using it in your proof in the first place. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085180"> If you read Wikipedia [Proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction) you see that the proof method depends on the Law of the excluded middle and that is one reason it is objectionable by some mathematicians. Your question is a very important one which is easily "swept under the rug". You are justified in questioning the method. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085216"> @Somos Glad to read I was not completely confused.  I'll look up the Law of the excluded middle in hopes of more clarity.  Thanks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085486"> @Somos: Proof by contradiction does not rely on the law of the excluded middle: it only requires the law of noncontradiction. The invocation of the law of the excluded middle that is often associated with a proof by contradiction is about proving a proposition from its double negation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085668"> Possible duplicate of [Are proofs by contradiction really logical?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1667884/are-proofs-by-contradiction-really-logical) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085675"> Athough what Hurkyl said above is true for **some** definitions of "proof by contradiction", the typical variant that mathematics students encounter in textbooks and classes are actually of the form "<span class="math-container" id="22781667" visual_id="3470208"><math alttext="\neg A\to\bot\vdash A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mo>⊥</mo><mo>⊢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>", which **does** require LEM (the law of excluded middle) to justify fully. Hence I think the link I've provided will give a fuller answer to your question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086493"> @somos It is also worth pointing out that the problem Stephen is asking about has nothing to do with the excluded middle, but rather with there not being contradictions in the axioms. Of course for (I want to say most) a fair amount of proofs by contradiction you don't actually need to prove the result that way it's just easier. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086542"> It is also worth noting that people sometme make mistakes and so if you end up in a contradiction one possibility is that a mistake in reasoning is the cause. How can you decide between this possibility and/or that the proposition P is false? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086812"> @Somos If you make a direct proof, it is also a possibility that a mistake in reasoning has occurred, how is this any different? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086825"> @Morgan Rodgers Because in a direct proof you can check each of the statements for correctness. In a proof by contradicition you can't. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087619"> @Somos In both cases, you are often going to have difficulty checking the correctness of a given statement (if you could just "check" the correctness of the statement you are trying to prove, why would you need to prove it?). You can only check that each statement you are making is properly justified by the assumptions you have made. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087703"> Checking a statement is not the same as "proving" it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087765"> @DoughnutPump  I now see what you mean. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087778"> <span class="math-container" id="22781751" visual_id="202"><math alttext="Q" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math></span> cannot originate from outside of our system of axioms.  So, either it was *unknowingly*/*accidentally* assumed in the proof (in which case the proof is not a valid one - but not because of the method of a PbC), or it has already been proven in the system in which we are working, in which case, it cannot be the cause of the contradiction (unless some of our axioms are inconsistent - which is by definition false).   So indeed, back to proof-101 - be sure of the veracity of every statement!  To avoid introducing a ''<span class="math-container" id="22781751" visual_id="202"><math alttext="Q" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math></span>'' in it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088917"> @DoughnutPump: Your comment is inaccurate. See my answer for an explicit example (at the end) where we can have some assumption that contributes to the contradiction but is totally part of a valid proof. In fact, in many proof systems (especially Fitch-style) you necessarily have to consider assumptions in order to prove certain statements (such as conditional statements), **regardless of** whether you know it's true or not. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088925"> @Somos: Your comment raises an interesting issue, but perhaps it may not be so clear to other readers. What you are saying is that in a direct proof (namely not using LEM or DNE or proof by contradiction) every statement that you deduce is empirically verifiable, whereas in an indirect proof, since you can deduce anything from a contradiction, it's entirely possible that every statement you have deduced under a false assumption is also false, and so one cannot 'double-check' each by testing it independently. That's indeed true, and you may want to look up the BHK interpretation for more. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5089101"> @user21820 Thanks, you got it right. That is what I am claiming. Every statement in a direct proof can be spot checked for validity, In a contradiction proof, statments can be true or false so you have to fall back on making sure that each step follows logically from previous steps. My concern is more for validity of statements than validity of proof methods, although proofs should use valid inferences but it's harder to check. I knew about BHK type interpretations, but I am not into proofs as object of manipulation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5091339"> @Somos: By the way, you're welcome to the [logic chat-room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/44058/logic) if you'd like further discussion, including about the posts I've linked. =) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5096528"> How about a simple case: Where one of the prior assumptions (a1,a2,a3..) was really an assumption, not a logic deduction  Then you might have just injected a proposition that was an alternative to a2.  Now your argument doesn't imply new mathematics but that you inserted a proposition that had a different branch than the internally assumed a2.  Neither is correct or incorrect logically; just inconsistent with each other.  For example, Euclid's parallel line "axiom".  If I have misinterpreted your question, let me know and I will delete this! </td></tr>

<p>In mathematics, we deduce theorems from axioms, so we end up knowing that the theorems are true in any situation where the axioms are true. We get no information about situations where some of the axioms are false. </p> <p>Now suppose we prove a theorem T by contradiction; we assume not-T and, by means of this assumption plus our axioms, we arrive at a contradiction.  Then we know that either not-T is false or (at least) one of our axioms is false. That knowledge is exactly the same as knowing that <strong>if</strong> the axioms are true, then not-T must be false and therefore T must be true. If, on the other hand, some of the axioms are false, then we get no information.</p> <p>So the information we get from the proof by contradiction is the same as what we'd get from a direct proof: As long as the axioms are true, we know T; if some axioms are false, all bets are off.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="5085033"> I'm not fully sure I understand what you mean by 'false' axioms.  Isn't an axiom by definition true, and so all statements deduced from them are also true in the system formed by the axioms?  I'm not sure I understand what is a 'false' axiom. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085085"> @Stephen One of the usual axioms about the natural numbers is that <span class="math-container" id="22781670" visual_id="92"><math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>0</mn></semantics></math></span> is not the immediate successor of anything. If someone were to take theorems about the natural numbers and claim that they're also true about the real numbers, I'd tell him that he's wrong because that axiom, true of the natural numbers, is false of the real numbers.  More generally, axioms are (barring errors) true in the situation that they're intended to describe, but they can be false in other situations. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085195"> Would it be more correct to say that the axioms are *inconsistent* than to say that they're *false*? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085219"> @templatetypedef No. Consistent axioms, like the standard axioms about <span class="math-container" id="22781671" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span>, can be false when one attempts to apply them to other contexts like <span class="math-container" id="22781673" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>.  If the axioms were inconsistent, they'd be false in **all** situations. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085239"> Even properties, can become false if applied in the wrong context. That's partially why, this site is so hung up on specifics for problems. without conventions and context if I say ab without defining with context what a or b are, it could be string concatenation, or multiplication,etc. and a could be a real number, and maybe so is b so what's the value of ab if they are real is this true of when they aren't ? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5085997"> [We do not know that the axioms we use are non-contradictory (whence it could be the case that they cannot be true all at once)!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Second_incompleteness_theorem) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086255"> @yo' I assume that by "we do not know" you mean something like "we cannot prove, on the basis of those same axioms," so that your comment is justified by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. If we consider other means of knowing things, the justification is a lot weaker. For example, a clear intuition of the cumulative hierarchy may well allow us to know that ZFC is consistent. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086272"> @Stephen I think your confusion about "aren't axioms true" might go away if you called them "hypotheses" and "definitions" relevant in your probem, leaving "axioms" to refer to the usual rules of logic and proof which is really OK since you're not asking about fundamentals that tangle with things like Godel's theorem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086504"> @AndreasBlass I don't know. Given some of the work I've seen on pulling back theorems to minimal axiomatic structures, ZFC might just be way too strong to be consistent. I'm joking a bit, but it really is a huge sledge hammer for 99% of mathematics. I still really like it of course. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086520"> @AndreasBlass Yes, that's what I mean. I should have said "we cannot know" of course! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086528"> @DRF I agree that ZFC is more than needed for most of mathematics. Nevertheless, the intuition of the cumulative hierarchy of sets shows that it's consistent. Once I know that ZFC is consistent, I can, of course, deduce the consistency of weaker theories, like those used in reverse mathematics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086531"> @DRF: Incidentally, I think ZFC is elegant and consistent, but I'm not sure whether it's arithmetically sound. And I believe that nearly all the mathematics needed to develop real-world applications can be done in ACA. What do you think? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086539"> @AndreasBlass: I'm personally not convinced that one can have an intuition of the cumulative hierarchy without assuming something that is more or less equivalent to the replacement schema from ZFC. In fact, a number of logicians in history have pointed out this exact defect in the iterative conception, including Boolos. It seems we **can** reasonably justify countable stages, but do not seem to be able to justify a stage after all of them, without assuming the existence of an uncountable well-ordering of labels for all countable stages. Any thoughts about that? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086554"> @user21820 By Gödel's theorem, any intuition adequate for showing that ZFC is consistent (like the intuition of the cumulative hierarchy) cannot be formalized without using some assumption that goes beyond ZFC. But I was not talking about formalizing the intuition, just about using it in order to see that ZFC is consistent. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086732"> @AndreasBlass: Yes I know that, but like with PA, it's not necessary that one needs something strictly stronger, so the question or hope is that someone can give a justification for ZF[C] or perhaps even just Con(ZF[C]) that requires less philosophical commitment in some aspects and more in some other aspects, that at least might seem plausibly more reasonable. More precisely, can you give a reason why you think it is more justifiable to believe that ZF is arithmetically sound than to believe that ZF is arithmetically unsound? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5086933"> @user21820 There is some evidence that ZF is arithmetically sound. (1) Its axioms are evidently true in the cumulative hierarchy.  (2) No one has yet deduced from ZFC an arithmetical statement that we know (or even suspect) to be false.  (Of course neither (1) nor (2) is as convincing as a mathematical proof would be, but they are nevertheless reasonable evidence.)  In contrast, I don't know of any evidence that ZF is arithmetically unsound. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087760"> @AndreasBlass I think I understand what you mean in your original answer.  Basically, all axioms are assumed to be consistent in a specific system.  But, they may not be consistent in other systems.  Is this what you mean by false axioms? That is, they are ‘false’ in the system in which they cause contradictions? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087761"> I also understand why under this, a PbC is just as valid as a direct proof.  Still PbC seems to be more heavily dependent on LEM than a direct proof.  Why exactly is there a controversy about LEM?  Is it more of a philosophy of mathematics thing (a bit like Gödel's theorems) or there are also solid grounds for questioning it in mainstream mathematics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087840"> @Stephen I was using "false" in the semantic sense of "false in a structure" (like <span class="math-container" id="22781673" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>), but similar things could be said about the syntactic notion of "inconsistent with some system of axioms." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5087849"> @Stephen LEM is used if you prove <span class="math-container" id="22781769" visual_id="318"><math alttext="P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math></span> by deducing a contradiction from <span class="math-container" id="22781770" visual_id="53281"><math alttext="\neg P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. But LEM is not involved in proving <span class="math-container" id="22781770" visual_id="53281"><math alttext="\neg P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> by deducing a contradiction from <span class="math-container" id="22781769" visual_id="318"><math alttext="P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math></span>.  Logical systems that reject LEM are usually based not on "true vs. false" like classical logic but on "known vs. unknown" or "proved vs. unprovable". For more details, you should look up "intuitionism" and "constructive logic". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088892"> @Stephen: As explained in my linked post, there is little philosophical ground to question LEM for statements about reality. Mathematicians mostly also believe that statements about natural numbers (such as "Every positive integer is the sum of four squares.") are statements about reality in an abstract sense, and so would have no reason to question LEM for these statements. There are many other kinds of statements, and one may be justified to question LEM for them. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5088899"> @Stephen: Also, Godel's theorems are **not** a philosophy thing at all, and are absolutely true of **any** useful formal system that can reason about natural numbers or finite strings. Of course, the incompleteness theorems themselves can only be proven or justified in some formal system or logical framework that permits the required deductive steps, but the required assumptions are so mild that anyone who doubts the truth of the incompleteness theorems will also doubt the vast majority of concrete mathematics, not to say modern mathematics. </td></tr>
