<p>Space of ordinal numbers are one of the favorite examples of my professor in general topology. I quite understand the idea at the base of ordinal numbers (few things or nothing about the concept of ordinal itself in set theory). What we were told was just about constructing bigger and bigger ordinals like putting boxes into boxes into boxes...and that starting at a certain ordinal number, there are finite steps backwards and infinite forward.</p> <p>So I still don't have a clear what a finite and what a successor ordinal are, I know the definitions and I have a vague idea, but I can't link it in a successful way with the proposition I reported at the end of the previous paragraph.</p> <p>If somebody could explain these concepts in a better way, maybe then I could understand how to verify or disprove base-numerability, compactness and other important topological properties on the space. I'm not now interested in the ZF theory but in understanding how to manage and work on this space, in particular on <span class="math-container" id="2006109" visual_id="466159"><math alttext="[0,\Omega]" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> or <span class="math-container" id="2006110" visual_id="470729"><math alttext="[0,\Omega)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span>, where <span class="math-container" id="2006111" visual_id="1233"><math alttext="\Omega" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi></semantics></math></span> id the first uncountable ordinal.</p>

<p>Ordinals are naturally ordered, and this ordering is a well-ordering. Namely, every non-empty set of ordinal has a least element. You can think about them as a continuation of the natural numbers. First we add <span class="math-container" id="2006274" visual_id="4986"><math alttext="\omega" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ω</mi></semantics></math></span> which is the supremum of <span class="math-container" id="2006275" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span>, then we add another point, <span class="math-container" id="2006276" visual_id="30651"><math alttext="\omega+1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ω</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>, etc. etc. </p> <p>Linear orders are particularly easy to define a topology from, we simply take the basic open sets to be intervals. Much like we would do in <span class="math-container" id="2006277" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> or <span class="math-container" id="2006278" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℚ</mi></semantics></math></span>.</p> <p>There are generally two types of ordinals, successor ordinals and singular ordinals. Successor ordinals correspond to (linear) well-orders which have a maximal elements, for example if you add a point above all the natural numbers the order type is a successor ordinal, those would correspond to closed intervals, in some sense. Limit ordinals are, as the name suggests, limit of smaller ordinals and are not successor, to return to this example again the point which is the maximum in the aforementioned order (naturals+maximum) is itself a limit ordinal, often denoted <span class="math-container" id="2006279" visual_id="4986"><math alttext="\omega" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ω</mi></semantics></math></span>. Oh yes, there is also zero which corresponds to the empty set.</p> <p>Finite ordinals are either zero or a natural number. In most modern mathematics natural numbers in set theory are often seen as the finite ordinals. Infinite ordinals are simply ordinals that have infinitely many points below them.</p> <p>One of the qualities ordinal spaces offer is that every closed interval is compact, since being well-ordered is equivalent to the fact that there is no infinite decreasing sequence, so by covering with intervals the endpoints form a decreasing sequence which must be finite. They are also rich in isolated points, namely every successor ordinal is an isolated point. In fact the isolated points are exactly the successor ordinals and zero.</p> <p>In the particular case of <span class="math-container" id="2006280" visual_id="466159"><math alttext="[0,\Omega]" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="2006281" visual_id="470729"><math alttext="[0,\Omega)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> the one thing to remember is that a countable sequence of countable ordinals have a countable limit (in ZFC), furthermore by their well-order every sequence of ordinals is either finite or contains an increasing sequence, and therefore has a limit point. Thus both the spaces are sequentially compact. The former space is a closed interval, and as remarked, is also compact; however the latter space is not compact since we can cover it with infinitely many disjoint intervals.</p> <p>I feel that I cannot go much beyond that without getting into deeper parts of the theory of ordinals, and I feel that to truly understand these spaces you need to have at least some basic understanding on how ordinals work (order, arithmetics, etc.) as it is tied deeply with the properties of ordinal spaces.</p> <p>Don't feel bad though. In my second year we were given the classical example of <span class="math-container" id="2006282" visual_id="231204"><math alttext="\omega_{1}+1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>ω</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> as a compact ordinal space. I didn't understand much at the time, and it took some set theory course later to understand the example in full.</p>
