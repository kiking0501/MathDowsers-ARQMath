<p>I along with one of my friends were just discussing some basic things in group theory, when this question came up:</p> <ul> <li>What are some <em>fundamental results</em> in group theory?</li> </ul> <p>We happened to list out some:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphism:</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Cayley's Theorem</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Sylow's Theorem</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>There may be many more, but as far as my little knowledge is concerned, i think these are very important. Then we started explaining why each one of the above results were more powerful. I could explain as to how the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphism</em>  can be used to derive some good results, in group theory, and also i could show my friends the power of the <em>Sylow Theorems</em> just by considering groups of order <span class="math-container" id="90244" visual_id="42056"><math alttext="pq" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> <span class="math-container" id="90245" visual_id="6907"><math alttext="\bigl{(}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo maxsize="120%" minsize="120%">(</mo></semantics></math></span> For e.g the case were <span class="math-container" id="90246" visual_id="478466"><math alttext="p\nmid(q-1)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>⁢</mo><merror class="ltx_ERROR undefined undefined"><mtext>\nmid</mtext></merror><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> <span class="math-container" id="90247" visual_id="6908"><math alttext="\bigr{)}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo maxsize="120%" minsize="120%">)</mo></semantics></math></span>. But i could never illustrate him as to how powerful Cayley's theorem is. </p> <blockquote> <p>Can anyone explain the significance of <em>Cayley's theorem</em> and why it plays a central role in group theory. I am also curious to know whether any important results proved in Group theory using <strong>Cayley's theorem.</strong></p> </blockquote>

<tr><td comment_id="21717"> In response to your list, I am a big fan of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups... but maybe you consider that a corollary. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21718"> Also, I find it strange. You care about groups of order pq, but what about other groups of specific order? If you do some exercises in Sylow theory, you will quickly find ones that require you to look at the induced automorphisms on subgroups, and they exploit Cayley's theorem and simplicity results of symmetric groups to get contradictions. If you are interested in groups of order pq, go look at classification of groups and how they use Cayley's. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21724"> @BBischof: Please post whatever you have in mind as an terse answer, so that many naive people may appreciate the question as well as the answer. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21726"> @BBischof: I consider groups of order <span class="math-container" id="90248" visual_id="42056"><math alttext="pq" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> because, i know that if <span class="math-container" id="90249" visual_id="6346653"><math alttext="p\not\mid(q-1)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo lspace="2.5pt" rspace="2.5pt">∤</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, then <span class="math-container" id="90288" visual_id="673"><math alttext="G" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>G</mi></semantics></math></span> is cyclic </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21732"> @Chandru, it isn't an answer really.

From what I've seen, I would say that's where it all begins.. </td></tr>

<p>It shows that the axiomatization of transformation groups is correct.  Any transformation group is an axiomatic group, and any axiomatic group -- a structure, or more precisely a "model", satisfying the group axioms -- is a group of transformations.  Historically, concrete groups of transformation appeared before abstract groups defined by algebraic axioms, so there is a question whether the algebra captures all (or possibly, more than) the intended examples.</p> <p>Also, Cayley's theorem with its initially strange but retroactively instinctive idea of considering a structure's internal "action on itself", promoting symmetries of an object to the status of an object in their own (collective) right, is an early example of the formal style typical of later algebra and it helps prepare the ground psychologically for working in an abstract or axiomatized mode that was new in the 19th century.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="21721"> +1.  Cayley's theorem may be obvious in retrospect, but there are natural ways to define groups (e.g. the fundamental group or homology groups) that don't act on any obvious object, so it was difficult to recognize these as groups before the axiomatic definition. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21725"> @Qiaochu: I have trouble in understanding your comment! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21728"> @Chandru1: those groups from topology (and many others not from topology) are defined by "generators and relations", not as transformations of any object.  They are constructed as axiomatic groups but not as transformation groups.  Cayley's theorem shows that they also belong to the latter class. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21729"> @Chandru1: people such as Riemann had been studying what were essentially homology groups before they were actually recognized as groups.  The reason they weren't is that if you only think of groups as transformation groups, it's hard to see what the homology groups are transforming.  Once the abstract definition of a group became well-known it was possible to see that homology wasn't just Betti numbers, it carried a group structure, and this was central to the development of algebraic topology. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="21733"> Yes, i understood somewhat! Have not read about fundamental groups. Guess thats the problem </td></tr>
