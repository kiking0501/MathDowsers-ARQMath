<h1> Is formal truth in mathematical logic a generalization of everyday, intuitive truth? </h1>

<div id="question" question_id="1781769">
<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around the relationship between truth in formal logic, as the value a formal expression can take on, as opposed to commonplace notions of truth.</p> <p>Personal background: When I was taking a class in formal logic last semester, I found that the most efficient way to do my homework was to forget my typical notions of truth and falsehood, and simply treat truth and falsehood as formal, abstract values that formal expressions may be assigned. In other words, I treated everything formally, which from the name of the course is presumably what I was supposed to do while solving problems.</p> <p>On the other hand, I came out of the course more confused than enlightened about what truth refers to in mathematics. For example, on what levels are each of the following two statements "true"?</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</li> <li>The empty function <span class="math-container" id="16460093" visual_id="1335430"><math alttext="f\colon\emptyset\to\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>ℝ</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is injective.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>For the first one, I can obviously see that there would be a contradiction if there were only finitely many prime numbers. To me, the classic proof by contradiction is not a "formal proof" or anything; it is merely a natural language argument that proves (in the everyday sense of the word "proves") why the statement must be true (in the everyday sense of the word "true").</p> <p>On the other hand, I run into trouble when I try to think about the second one. The very concept of the "empty function" doesn't even feel like it makes sense, but if I think about it as the relation between <span class="math-container" id="16460094" visual_id="1611"><math alttext="\emptyset" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="16460095" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> containing no elements, and then try to write out the statement formally, I get (if I did it correctly)</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="math-container" id="16460096" visual_id="7277566"><math alttext="\forall x\forall y(((x\in\emptyset)\land(y\in\emptyset)\land(f(x)=f(y)))% \implies(x=y))" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∀</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>∀</mo><mi>y</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>∧</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>∧</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span></p> </blockquote> <p>which I think has to be true in a formal sense (since the antecedent is always false?). But to be honest, I don't really know how to think about "truth" here; the situation feels much more confusing than with the first statement.</p> <p>So, in conclusion, my questions are:</p> <blockquote> <p>In what sense is each of the above statements "true"? And, more generally,</p> <p>Is the notion of truth in (mathematical) logic <em>just</em> a formal value assigned to expressions? Or should I think of it as encompassing, but also generalizing, the intuitive notion of a true statement?</p> </blockquote> <p>(Any insightful comments or answers are appreciated, even if they don't address all of my questions directly.)</p>

<tr><td comment_id="3637483"> They are *true* because they are theorems of "established" mathematical theories. This means that they are proved (more or less "formally" does not matter) from **axiosm** of the respective theories. Of course, they are *true* **if** the axioms are. Mathematicians usually believe that the axioms of their theories are true, unless some contradiction has been discovered. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3637561"> I will bet somebody is going to comment that the "classic" (as in classical Greek culture) proof of the infinitude of prime numbers is (was) not by contradiction. I would like to add that it was not a proof of any infinitude either, because the existence of infinite collections was considered absurd at the time. Rather the proof was that any [sic] collection of prime numbers can be extended by new ones (and it was a constructive proof). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3637590"> Don't confuse your confusion about truth in mathematics with your confusion about the empty function and its injectivity! These are really quite different matters. I can give an intuitive, natural language proof for (2) just as easily as for (1): To say that a function is injective is to say that no two distinct elements of the domain get sent to the same element of the codomain by the function. Since there isn't any pair of distinct elements in the domain of the empty function, this condition clearly holds, so the empty function is injective. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3637655"> @MauroALLEGRANZA: What you have written only really applies to axioms of set theory (to an extent). E.g., you don't "believe" that field axioms are true. You just check when they are and when they aren't. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3638166"> From one perspective, an intuitive natural-language argument is strong evidence that a purely formal proof exists. Whether or not there is a corresponding natural-language argument that feels satisfying (see e.g. user21820's answer, for instance) is up to you, but that's separate from what is true/false. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3638776"> @AlexKruckman To me, vacuous truths do not make intuitive sense—in the real world, in a room where there are no cellphones, I would not claim that "all cell phones in the room are turned off" is either true or false—so the statement, "the empty function is injective," actually highlights, for me, the need for formal rules governing mathematical "truth." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3638893"> @justin One can debate to what degree the meanings of logical connectives in mathematics agree with their everyday usage in natural language (I think you'll find it depends heavily on context and idiom). But these connectives have clear well-defined meanings when we're talking about mathematics, even when we're giving intuitive natural language proofs like the one you have in mind for the infinitude of the primes. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3638899"> @justin And by the way, I emphatically disagree with you on the cell phone example. Vacuous truths *do* (often) make intuitive sense in non-mathematical contexts. Let's say you're on an airplane and the pilot says "For safety reasons, before we take off, all cell phones on board must be turned off". Just because it's 1995 and no one on board happens to have a cell phone doesn't mean it's any less safe to take off... the condition "all cell phones on board are turned off" for a safe take off has been satisfied - it's true! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3639493"> @AlexKruckman: I think that, in everyday English, "all cell phones on board must be turned off" presupposes that there are cell-phones on board. The allowed-to-be-vacuously-true version is "*any* cell phones on board must be turned off". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3639605"> @AlexKruckman +1 for the empty function proof. Actually, I think there's another example in the same spirit: under the definition of a closed set in a metric space as "a set that contains  all its limit points", <span class="math-container" id="16460097" visual_id="3375"><math alttext="\mathbb{Z}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℤ</mi></semantics></math></span> (usual topology) is closed, since it has apparently *no* limit point at all. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3639730"> It's unclear to me what you mean by "generalizing". Suppose you have total two functions <span class="math-container" id="16460173" visual_id="1"><math alttext="f" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>f</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="16460099" visual_id="627"><math alttext="g" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>g</mi></semantics></math></span> that assign truth values to closed mathematical statements.  If they agree on all inputs, neither generalizes the other. If they don't agree on some input, then they are incompatible and neither generalizes the other.  You might say that mathematical truth has a smaller domain, and so it's a specialization of the everyday notion of truth. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3640034"> @AlexKruckman While we may have different intuitions, intuition is subjective, so I don't know if it makes sense to say *we* disagree—I think it's our intuitions about (and definitions of) truth that disagree. I've realized over the course of asking this question that if one wants to be purely objective, then the everyday, intuitive notion of truth is problematic precisely *because* it is intuitive—it may vary from person to person. I'm sure if I asked you to precisely enough define what you mean by "true" in the airplane example, I'd end up agreeing with you that the condition was satisfied. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3641225"> Natural language is merely a vehicle for communication, and most of them are severely ambiguous to the point that a large fraction of meaning cannot be found in the spoken utterances, and even less in the written text. So while you are right that the way we interpret sentences in English, such as those involving quantifying determiners, differ slightly from person to person, our intuitive notion of truth of the **intended meaning** doesn't. That is what classical logic was invented to capture in the first place, so it ought to match our intuition about the truth value of the intended meaning. </td></tr>

<p>The answer is both, due to the quirks of formal language.  Truth is both a label assigned to expressions and also a specific concept related to your intuition.  The reason for this dichotomy is most apparent in the work of Alfred Tarksi and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski's_undefinability_theorem" rel="nofollow">undefinability theorem</a>.</p> <p>Tarski's theorem tugs at the corners of the fabric of mathematics.  He showed that, for any theory strong enough to prove all truths in arithmetic (i.e. 1+1=2, 3*5=15, and so on) and had negation, it could not define its own semantics.  The specific statement he proved was that it could not define a function <code>True</code> such that <code>True(encode(s))</code>, where <code>encode(s)</code> was an encoded expression in that language gave the truth value for <code>s</code>.  He used a really twisted little trick known as the diagonalization lemma to basically wedge the system against itself and prove that there must be a case where the <code>True</code> function breaks down.</p> <p>In many cases, we are not considering such powerful self referential systems.  Usually we're using a powerful system to prove something smaller and specific.  For example, we may use first order logic and ZF set theory to prove a statement about the cardinality of large sets.  In this sense, we are using the idea of "truth" as a label that can be applied within that system.</p> <p>However, when we start exploring deeper "truths" which start to stretch the limit of our proof system, we start to find that the simple concept of "truth as a label" ceases to be as useful as it was in the simpler cases.  We start relying more on the semantic meaning of "truth" rather than the syntactic one.  Thanks to Tarski's work, we can prove that that semantic meaning <em>must</em> come from elsewhere.  It must have a deeper meaning.</p> <p>This eventually does push its way into the philosophy of mathematics, where we have to define what mathematics calls "truth."  At this point, we can define "truth" any way we want, it's just a word, but there is an intuitive benefit for "truth" to have a meaning closely related to the intuitive concepts we all use.</p> <p>A case study in the differences here is the difference between ZF and ZFC axioms for set theory.  The axiom of choice is a remarkably intuitive axiom, but it has profoundly non-intuitive effects.  In ZFC, it is possible to take a sphere, cut it into a finite number of pieces, rotate and translate those pieces, and reassemble them into two perfect spheres, each with the same volume as the original.  These new spheres are not swiss cheese: they are a dense sphere, just like the original one.</p> <p>In ZFC, the expressions used to describe this slice and dice operaton are deemed "true," because their syntactic description is formed from a series of valid inferences in first order logic with ZFC.  However, the idea that I can double my volume of spheres without decreasing their density in any way runs so afoul of our intuitive sense of "truth" that many mathematicians refuse to accept proofs done in ZFC.</p>
