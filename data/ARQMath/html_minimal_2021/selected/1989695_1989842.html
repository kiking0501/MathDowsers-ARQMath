<p>This is a by product of <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1989631/is-there-a-self-consistent-world-of-mathematics-where-the-fundamental-theorem-of">this recent question</a>, where the concept of <em>ultrafinitism</em> came up. I was under the impression that <em>finitism</em> was just "some ancient philosophical movement" in mathematics, only followed by one or two nowadays, so It sounded like a joke to me.</p> <p>But then I got curious and, after reading a bit, It seems to me that the only arguments against <em>infinite mathematics</em> that finitists seem to have are that "there are numbers so big that we couldn't computate in a lifetime" or the <em>naive set theory paradoxes</em>. The former doesn't seem like a serious argument, and the latter is not a problem now that mathematics relies on consistent axioms.</p> <p>Are there some (maybe arguably) good mathematical reason to deny the existence of <span class="math-container" id="18430256" visual_id="2076"><math alttext="\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">‚àû</mi></semantics></math></span> or is it just a philosophical attitude? The concept of unboundedness seems pretty natural to me, so what could be a reason to avoid it? Does this attitude even make any sense?</p> <p>In short, <strong>why today-finitists have a problem with <span class="math-container" id="18430257" visual_id="2076"><math alttext="\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">‚àû</mi></semantics></math></span>?</strong></p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> First of all, thank you so much for your answers (and comments), they have been enormously illuminating. :)</p> <p>I didn't know that "<em>finitism vs. infinitism</em>" was such a polemic topic. Now I myself agree this question might look as <em>primarily opinion-based</em>. However, It was not my intention to open a debate about "which posture is better"; I was just meaning to ask about <strong>what specific mathematical reason (argued and not-primarily opinion based) do finitists have to reject the "infinitists" use of infinity</strong>.</p> <p>Based on the two excellent answers I've already had (thank you again :) It is my understanding that their main problem with the use of <span class="math-container" id="18430258" visual_id="2076"><math alttext="\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">‚àû</mi></semantics></math></span> is that it leads to mathematical results (like the <em>Banach-Tarski paradox</em>) which they don't recognize as true when looked through the glasses of our real-world experience.</p> <p><strong>Final edit:</strong> After reading every answer and comment (specially <em>Asaf Karagila</em>'s) I've came to the conclussion that there are not <em>strictly mathematical</em> reason to avoid the use of infinite. That my specified question on the last edit has no answer, and that the motivation to stick to <em>finitists</em> or <em>infinitists</em> view of mathematics relies on how much one expects mathematics to describe each one's "real world". As <em>Wildcard</em>'s answer is the one that clarifies that matter best to me, I am accepting it. Thank you all again for your answers and comments! </p>

But the same question goes to that type of finitism; what is it that bugs them so much to think about constructions that we couldn't construct by hand? Is there a mathematical strong reason to stick to constructive mathematics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085104"> @Hugh I've just readed that post, pretty interesting. However I am not asking about finitism (or ultrafinitism) in a philosopical point of view. I am concerned with the mathematical point of view. Precisely if there are any mathematical reason (maybe arguable) to avoid infinity. I.e. why do they feel that infinite mathematics is a somewhat less reliable kind of mathematics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4086200"> @Hayden: That is not entirely accurate. We can easily prove the consistency of ZFC, or any theory we haven't found to be inconsistent yet. The main question is what is the meta-theory from which you are trying to prove this. We *know* that ZFC cannot prove its own consistency, so the question is, do you assume a stronger theory, or not? It should be pointed that the stronger theory will also be subject to this issue, and will not be able to prove its own consistency. So you have an infinite descent. But you can argue the same about almost anything mathematical. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4086225"> @mathbeing: The problem with the question is that there is no such thing as what you're asking for in boldface letters. This boils to personal beliefs, either about what mathematics *should* be, or about what mathematics is *about*. In either case, this is to do with the person reasoning, rather than a sound and mathematical argument. If there was a known inconsistency with infinite sets, we wouldn't be using them. But so far, all the "contradictions" only come from lack of understanding of arguments or "I don't get it, so it must be wrong" sort of attacks. [...] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4086230"> [...] Ultimately, this is a matter of opinion, just like choosing your mathematical foundation to be ZFC or HOTT or category theory is a matter of personal preference: what mathematics you *like* to do, and *how* you think you'll have the easiest time arguing your mathematical argument as readably while being as formal as possible. Since there are no *mathematical* arguments as to why to prefer one foundation over the other (as long as all of them are not provably inconsistent, that is), the question becomes philosophical and a matter of personal and social choice. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4086266"> @AsafKaragila Honestly, I was expecting that there was not such a mathematical reason, but I thought that maybe the "assumption of infinity" raised up the "probability of inconsistency" in mathematics (if that can be given some sense). The motivation behind this question was to ensure that two concerns. Nevertheless, I feel that the lack of mathematical reasons is a perfectly valid answer. Maybe you can gather your comments in an answer for future readers. Anyway, thank you for your comments!! :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5738892"> Maybe in some very weak system of pure number theory, you have the rule of inference of induction and the rule of inference of universal quantification but the second rule of inference only lets you deduce from that statement that all natural number have a certain property that a specific natural number expressed in unary notation has that property. The system does not let you deduce from the statements for all x 2x exists and 2^20 exists, the statement that 2 √ó 2^20 exists so you can't deduce from it the statement 2^21 exists. </td></tr>

<div answer_id="1989842" id="answer">
<p>It's not known that modern set theory is consistent; in fact, by the Incompleteness Theorem, we can't ever have a system of axioms that we can prove is consistent. Which means that the only condition we can rely on for determining whether a set of axioms is "right" is whether or not it produces absurd results.</p> <p>Under <span class="math-container" id="18430262" visual_id="31598"><math alttext="ZFC" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, we have different sizes of infinity - there are sets which are larger than the set of natural numbers in a precise sense. We also have a lot of weirdness involving the Axiom of Choice - for example, with the Axiom of Choice, a theorem of Banach and Tarski states that a hollow sphere can be disassembled into five pieces and then reassembled (<em>without</em> stretching, tearing, or otherwise deforming the pieces) into two spheres that are both identical to the first one in both size and shape. But the Axiom of Choice simply states that given a set of sets, we can "choose" one element from each set - which seems intuitively true.</p> <p>A finitist's perspective on <span class="math-container" id="18430263" visual_id="31598"><math alttext="ZFC" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is often that results like the hierarchy of infinite cardinals and the Banach-Tarski paradox are absurd - that they should count as contradictions, because they patently disagree with the intuitive picture of mathematics. The sensible conclusion is that one of the axioms of <span class="math-container" id="18430264" visual_id="31598"><math alttext="ZFC" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is wrong. Most of them are intuitively obvious, because we can demonstrate them with finite sets - the only one we can't is Infinity, which states that there exists an infinite set. So a finitist's conclusion is to reject the Axiom of Infinity. Without that axiom, <span class="math-container" id="18430265" visual_id="31598"><math alttext="ZFC" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> becomes purely finitistic.</p> <p>Now, many finitists are happy to stop here. But some are bothered by the fact that we still have an infinite collection of natural numbers; the infinite still "exists", in a sense, and gives the opportunity for the above weirdnesses to arise in the same way. So some people (including some mathematicians) subscribe to ultrafinitism and insist that there are only finitely many numbers at all. One ultrafinitist mathematician I know defines the largest integer to be the largest integer that will ever be referenced by humans.</p> <p>Among mathematicians, ultrafinitists are much rarer than simple finitists. Finitists generally agree with you that "unboundedness" is a natural idea - it's essential, for example, in the definition of a limit. But they would go on to insist that this is just a formalism - that a limit, for example, is just a statement of eventual behavior, involving only finite numbers. So <span class="math-container" id="18430266" visual_id="2076"><math alttext="\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">‚àû</mi></semantics></math></span> isn't an object, it's just a shorthand. This is (at least to my mind) more mathematically defensible than ultrafinitism.</p> <p>EDIT: Since a lot of people seem to be having a hard time with my first sentence, I thought I'd clarify. The Incompleteness Theorem states that we cannot have a set of axioms powerful enough to express arithmetic and still be able to prove its consistency <em>within the system</em>. The reason I didn't include this phrase above is because it unnecessarily weakens the point. Any axiom system intended to codify <em>all of mathematics</em> defines the idea of "proof"; if, say, <span class="math-container" id="18430267" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span> is intended to underlie all of mathematics, then by "proof" we must mean "proof <em>in <span class="math-container" id="18430268" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span></em>". With such a <span class="math-container" id="18430269" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span>, we can say that <span class="math-container" id="18430270" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span> cannot be proven consistent at all; because by Incompleteness, any proof of the consistency of <span class="math-container" id="18430271" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span> would not be a proof from inside <span class="math-container" id="18430272" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span>, but <span class="math-container" id="18430273" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span> is supposed to be powerful enough that <em>all</em> proofs are proofs from inside <span class="math-container" id="18430274" visual_id="319"><math alttext="T" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>T</mi></semantics></math></span>. Thus: we can't ever have a system of axioms for mathematics that we can prove is consistent - full stop.</p>

You can reference "infinity" also, but that's not actually an integer.  How did you get this "largest integer" abstraction to which you refer?  (Hint: You didn't construct it.)  If you would argue with a mathematician, you must do so from the axioms with which he agrees. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085308"> @Alephnull You're assuming the axiom "every integer has a successor". An ultrafinitist would deny this axiom, and replace it with something like "every integer we can directly construct has a successor". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085437"> This is the best explanation of this I've ever seen. Thank you for sharing. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085677"> I am a little bit confused, both incompleteness theorems start with the consistency assumption, thus the "incompleteness" in their names. So "by the Incompleteness Theorem, we can't ever have a system of axioms that we can prove is consistent", it IS important to add "from within the system" and this is the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem. Otherwise we are left with a sense of fatality ;) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085691"> @rtybase Of course, but if we're talking about a system of axioms to underly *all of mathematics*, any consistency would have to be proven from within the system; thus we can't have a system of axioms that is both sufficiently powerful to cover all of mathematics *and* provably consistent. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085728"> http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/ &lt;<axiom ...="" a="" all="" and="" are="" are,="" arithmetical="" as="" axioms,="" be="" beyond="" by="" can="" conclusive.="" derivation="" even="" first="" for="" formal="" going="" g√∂del's="" in="" incorporates="" is="" mathematical="" mathematicians="" mathematics.="" methods="" more="" nor="" not="" now="" of="" ordinary="" provable="" proved="" proving="" regard="" require="" sense="" set="" such="" sufficient="" system="" than="" that="" the="" them="" theorem,="" theory="" there="" they="" thus="" today="" today's="" truths="" unproblematic="" using="" way="" which="" would="" zfc="" zfc.="" ‚Äúordinary‚Äù="">&gt; </axiom></td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085742"> @rtybase I'm very confused about what your confusion is. I agree ZFC is sufficient for mathematics; I agree that Incompleteness shows that ZFC doesn't prove everything. I agree that a larger system would be required to prove what's left over. Now, the thing is that unless this larger system incorporated methods completely incompatible with the modern notion of "proof", Incompleteness would apply to it as well. So I stand by what I said earlier: we can't have a system that is both powerful enough to cover everything and provably consistent. Is there something in there you're disagreeing with? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085748"> I stated it 4 comments ago &lt;<it "from="" add="" important="" is="" system"="" the="" to="" within="">&gt;. That will be 100% accurate and pretty much all ;) </it></td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4085756"> @rtybase OK, I understand your confusion now; but it's not. Not when we're talking about a system that's supposed to be representative of the concept of "proof". With any system that's intended to cover all of mathematics, "prove" *means* "prove within the system", because nothing outside the system would be considered a proof. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4086253"> The first sentence is a painful *painful* overstretching of the Incompleteness theorem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4087109"> @rtybase is actually correct.  I'll add that it is entirely impossible to prove that mathematical proof is the only means to arrive at a certainty of truth.  It is *one* method.  Mathematical proof is based on the *assumption* that mathematical proof *is* the means to arrive with certainty at correct conclusions.  Ironically, this assumption *itself* cannot be proven; it can only be empirically shown to be workable.  So yes, *"we can't ever have a system of axioms that we can prove is consistent"* ... **from *within* the system.** </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4088185"> @Wildcard I've edited the post to elaborate on my point; the phrase "from within the system" is an unnecessary weakening in this case. Also, I don't see how positing an additional means of certainty changes what can or cannot be *proven*; I agree that such a means might allow us to become certain of consistency, but it by definition does not constitute a *proof*. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4088190"> @AsafKaragila I disagree - I've added a paragraph to the end to elaborate on my point. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4088195"> Reese, I agree with your elaboration (mathematically, not quite philosophically), and this is why I didn't say that the first sentence is wrong, but rather a painful stretching of the incompleteness theorem. You're hiding essential details, and presenting it as if we can never prove that any theory is consistent. So you either question all the proof systems that we have in place, or you twist the arms of the incompleteness theorem behind the curtains to make it say what you want it to say. Either way, in a different discourse this might have been called out as dishonesty, if done on purpose. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4239268"> The statement by Reese that a hollow sphere can be duplicated with five pieces....should really be:  "a hollow sphere can be duplicated with four pieces". Five pieces are needed for the solid piece, since the center of the ball causes a problem with the radial extension of the classic 4-piece solution. </td></tr>
