<p>There are many counter-intuitive results in mathematics, some of which are listed <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/139699/what-are-some-examples-of-a-mathematical-result-being-counterintuitive">here</a>. However, most of these theorems involve infinite objects and one can argue that the reason these results seem counter-intuitive is our intuition not working properly for infinite objects.</p> <p>I am looking for examples of counter-intuitive theorems which involve only finite objects. Let me be clear about what I mean by "involving finite objects". The objects involved in the proposed examples should not contain <em>an infinite amount of information</em>. For example, a singleton consisting of a real number is a finite object, however, a real number simply encodes a sequence of natural numbers and hence contains an infinite amount of information. Thus the proposed examples should not mention any real numbers.</p> <p>I would prefer to have statements which do not mention infinite sets at all. An example of such a counter-intuitive theorem would be the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice" rel="noreferrer">non-transitive dice</a>. On the other hand, allowing examples of the form <span class="math-container" id="18883362" visual_id="137673"><math alttext="\forall n\ P(n)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∀</mo><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> or <span class="math-container" id="18883363" visual_id="1177914"><math alttext="\exists n\ P(n)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∃</mo><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> where <span class="math-container" id="18883364" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> ranges over some countable set and <span class="math-container" id="18883365" visual_id="318"><math alttext="P" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math></span> does not mention infinite sets would provide more flexibility to get nice answers.</p> <p>What are some examples of such counter-intuitive theorems?</p>

I'm curious why; if we adopt the strengthening due to Rosser, the incompleteness theorem states "If PA is consistent, then PA is not complete." Although this requires quantification over naturals, it does not require direct reference to infinite sets, so seems to fit your more general version (or does the fact that it involves *two* quantifiers matter?). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4195842"> (Cont'd) By the way, the incompleteness theorem has a one-quantifier version: unwinding the proof, there's a primitive recursive function <span class="math-container" id="18883476" visual_id="1"><math alttext="f" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>f</mi></semantics></math></span> such that if <span class="math-container" id="18883651" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> is the Goedel-number of a PA-proof of the Rosser sentence <span class="math-container" id="18883370" visual_id="3450575"><math alttext="R_{PA}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></msub></semantics></math></span>, then <span class="math-container" id="18883371" visual_id="9133"><math alttext="f(n)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is the Goedel-number of a PA-proof of "<span class="math-container" id="18883372" visual_id="4435"><math alttext="0=1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>". Then via the usual representation machinery, the incompleteness theorem can be stated with one quantifier: namely, saying that <span class="math-container" id="18883476" visual_id="1"><math alttext="f" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>f</mi></semantics></math></span> does what I just said it did.

If you pick a specific instance for a theory, then yes you can state it with one or two quantifiers. But in this case, it is not as striking as the general version. (Imagine the scenario where the theorem held for PA, but not for some recursive extension. Then you would be blaming PA for its incompleteness rather than being amazed at that it is insufficient.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4197167"> [Pairwise independent, but not mutually independent dice sides](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/720045/probability-of-a-tetrahedron-die-with-4-faces) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4197765"> @Burak Even the more general version can be finitized (although AFAICT more quantifiers are needed): there is an explicit primitive recursive function which, when given a primitive recursive code for any primitive recursively axiomatizable theory extending PA, outputs the Goedel number of a sentence which is unprovable in that theory unless that theory is inconsistent. This can all be expressed with a few quantifiers over <span class="math-container" id="18883637" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span>, and no direct reference to infinite sets. Now, whether it can be gotten down to *one* quantifier is harder ... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4198747"> personally I find almost all of modern mathematics astonishing.  just look at groups - N under addition is the same as N+ under multiplication!  who woulda thunk it?  same for finite groups-zowie!

<p>Here is a consequence of the <em><a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/Chapter12.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Arc sine law for last visits</a></em>. Let's assume playing with a fair coin.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Theorem (false)</strong> <em>In a long coin-tossing game each player will be on the winning side for about half the time, and the lead will pass not infrequently from one player to the other.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The following text is from the classic <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/8126518057" rel="noreferrer">An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, volume 1</a></em>, by William Feller.</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><p>According to widespread beliefs a so-called law of averages should ensure the <em>Theorem</em> above.

<tr><td comment_id="4192543"> just started reading this as finally had some time on hands. looking  forward to that chapter! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4202612"> I would think about this like a random walk. The walk could cross the y-axis often, but it's just as likely it's wandered off to one half or the other </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4203107"> @DylanFrese: I fully agree. This is also my preferred modelling of the situation. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4205623"> Out of context, depending on which statistics you look at, the statement about "the results of a huge number of independent games at one given instant" seems either trivial (the lead can change during a series of games, but not during a number of simultaneous games) or untrue (if there are <span class="math-container" id="18883530" visual_id="320"><math alttext="N" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>N</mi></semantics></math></span> games in either case and <span class="math-container" id="18883523" visual_id="115"><math alttext="X" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi></semantics></math></span> is the total number of heads, how does sequence vs. simultaneous affect the moments of <span class="math-container" id="18883523" visual_id="115"><math alttext="X" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi></semantics></math></span>?). I presume there was some discussion prior to that statement that explains it better. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214424"> @DavidK: If I understand correctly, what it's saying is this: if you gather scores of a single long-running game after every *N* flips, you'll get a very different distribution than if you gather scores of many independent games of *N* flips. In the long-running game, you might expect that scores will tend to stay near 0 (so that scores &lt; -*N* or &gt; *N*, while possible, are extremely unlikely, so don't affect the overall shape of the distribution), but in fact scores far from 0 are quite likely. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214879"> @DavidK: In English, "after every *N* flips" means "after the Nth flip, after the (2N)th flip, after the (3N)th flip, etc.". So if *N* = 1000 and you collect 100 scores, then in the long-running game you will have observed 100,000 flips, just as in the case of multiple simultaneous games. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214899"> @DavidK: Property #2 is the one you don't have. Scores are cumulative; so in the long-running game, the first score counts the first *N* flips, the second score counts the first 2N flips, etc. (So, for example, if *N* = 3, and the results of the flips are HHH HHH HHH ..., then in the long-running game the cumulative scores are 3 6 9 ..., whereas in the simultaneous games the scores are all 3.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214920"> @DavidK: Well, remember, the *expected* score (the mean of the distribution of scores) is always 0. So the expected score after N flips is the same as the expected score after 10N flips. So you might naively expect the distributions to be the same. (This naive expectation is informally called the "Law of Averages".) But in fact, the standard-deviation of scores after 10N flips is far greater than the standard-deviation of scores after N flips, so the distributions are very different. If you don't find that surprising/counterintuitive, then great! But many people do. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214928"> @DavidK: (I should make clear, by the way, that I haven't read that book. I'm just telling you how I interpret it based on this answer. But I'm pretty sure my interpretation is the right one, or nearly so.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4214970"> @DavidK: "Same mean implies same distribution" would always be a fallacy, but it's not intuitive when phrased like that. It's only in the context of an ongoing sequence like this that it (or its consequences) can seem intuitive, and therefore be a fallacy that people actually fall into. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4215002"> @ruakh Here's the chapter in question: cbmc.it/~marchettil/LinguaggiBioinfo/Feller-chap3.pdf It's quite interesting, of course. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4215188"> @DavidK: I've added an example from section 4 which is quite illustrative. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216170"> Trying to parse the example: by "a great many coin-tossing games" we mean many independent _series_ of coin tosses, each series consisting of over thirty million flips (one per second, continuing for a year), right? And taking each entire _series_ as a "game," if I understand the table on page 83, in the majority of games there is no change in who is "ahead" during the last 311 days of the year. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216199"> The question regarding the quote from the start of the chapter is, what does it mean by "the results of a huge number of independent games at one given instant," what _true_ fact about those results is being incorrectly assumed to hold for a single long-running game, and how easily can one show that the two situations are not comparable? (Also, by "various applications" do we mean published scientific results, and if so, which ones?) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216204"> I can think of one _false_ interpretation of the Law of Large Numbers for simultaneous games that applies, namely the notion that in a million simultaneous flips the absolute difference between the number of heads and tails will be small. Because of this false notion, one may think that after a million flips one player will probably lead by only a few points and the lead could easily switch in just a few seconds. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216323"> @DavidK: I agree with your interpretation regarding independent series of coin tosses. I'm also pretty sure, that Feller refers to published scientific results, but I'm not aware of these. For me it looks plausible that such wrong assumptions even done be some experts could have been a major motivation for emphasizing these aspects the way he did. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216427"> Perhaps the purpose of the statement about "various applications" was meant to be provocative, to motivate someone to read the chapter. (It worked for me, anyway!) It may be that its exact meaning was never intended to be explained. Certainly the rest of the chapter contains many very well-explained, precise statements that are also surprising or indicative of fallacies, including a questionable inference by Galton in 1876 (page 70). On page 88, "even trained statisticians expect" the lead in the sequential game to change far more often than it actually is likely to. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4216475"> @DavidK: Nice interpretation! Good to see that my answer is stimulating. :-) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5163034"> It shows how much of what we learn we take for granted.  Because I read other answers which others say are "not counterintuitive at all" to them, and I did not agree.  But I read this one and it isn't counterintuitive at all to me - it's obvious.  The point being... I read probability and stats at uni. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5163137"> @RobertFrost: Probability and stats is definitely advantageous. :-) But besides that I have also learned from the authors, that we shouldn't take things for granted only because they are plausible. We should always look for a good reasoning. </td></tr>
