<p>One can read in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia page for "Gödel's incompleteness theorems"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Undecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does   not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the truth value   of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by   other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive   system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the   statement. Whether there exist so-called "absolutely undecidable"   statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified,   is a controversial point in the philosophy of mathematics.</p> </blockquote> <p>NB: The same text appears in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia page for "Undecidable Problem"</a>.</p> <p>I don't understand this. It seems to me that there are a couple of theorems in mathematical logic which, on the contrary, very clearly explain the relation between the undecidability of a statement and its "truth value": depending on the meaning of "truth value", I am thinking about Post's tautology theorem and Gödel's completeness theorem.</p> <p>Am I missing something? And what does Wikipedia mean by "absolutely undecidable"?</p> <p>Let me elaborate in a little bit for clarity. My understanding is that by the completeness theorem, a statement is undecidable if and only if there exist models in which it is true and other models in which it is false. Moreover (or alternatively), by the tautology theorem of Post, a statement is undecidable if and only if there exist some truth valuations for which it is true and others for which it is false. In any case, the conclusion, it seems to me, is simply that a statement is undecidable if and only if its truth value is not defined (it can be "chosen" true or false arbitrarily).</p> <hr/> <p><strong>EDIT</strong>. Let me add a couple of observations after reading the answers of 6005, user21820, and spaceisdarkgreen, which are not entirely satisfactory to me. These answers are defending Wikipedia's text by interpreting the meaning of "truth value" relatively to some kind of <em>correct model</em> or worse, <em>the physical world</em>. Neither of these notions have a place in mathematical logic, it seems to me. When talking about natural numbers, we may like to think there is a correct model, but it would be silly to assume that there is a "preferred universe" for every theory. </p> <p>For example, take Euclid's 5 axioms for geometry, remove axiom #5 (the "parallel postulate") so that you're left with only the first 4 axioms (you get "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry" rel="nofollow noreferrer">absolute geometry</a>"). Both the Euclidean plane and the hyperbolic plane are models for this theory. Is one of the two the "correct model"? Clearly no, since we got rid of the fifth axiom that would discriminate between the two.</p> <p>So at this point I still find that Wikipedia's assertion about "truth value" is still irrelevant.</p>

<p>Let's take as an example the Gödel sentence G for (first-order) PA which is undecidable in PA. It is also true, for it asserts that a (Gödel number of a) proof of itself does not exist, and indeed that number/proof does not exist. </p> <p>And yet the completeness theorem says that since PA+<span class="math-container" id="24174940" visual_id="16516"><math alttext="\lnot" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi></semantics></math></span>G is consistent, it has a model, i.e. some interpretation of first-order arithmetic has G false.</p> <p>So is G true or false or neither? It's true as a literal statement about numbers, and yet it's clear that there are models of PA which go either way. All this second part is really telling us is that there are models of PA in which some false statements about numbers are true. The axioms of PA are not enough to uniquely specify a model of arithmetic. These other models do indeed exist and are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nonstandard models of PA</a>.

<tr><td comment_id="5399258"> +1, I agree up until the last paragraph. When we talk about the "real" natural numbers, or what statements are true about them, this cannot be expressed even in ZFC. For ZFC can instelf have nonstandard models in which <span class="math-container" id="24174945" visual_id="4986"><math alttext="\omega" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ω</mi></semantics></math></span> will be nonstandard. ZFC does not solve the philosophical problem of fully describing the actual natural numbers. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5399260"> I also disagree with "there's no agreed upon 'correct' model that defines 'set theoretical truth.'" I think that set-theorists do imagine a correct, standard model of ZFC, it's just a bit harder to visualize. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5399283"> @6005 I certainly agree that ZFC doesn't resolve much here, and I didn't mean to insinuate that it did. It's not clear to me how it would, even if your very valid specific objection were invalid. Will delete that middle sentence. Regarding the second point I'm no expert, but I think opinions vary on this (multiverse, etc). Even so, the qualifier "agreed upon" seems pertinent. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400294"> Thanks for your answer. 1. What allows you to write "indeed that number/proof does not exist"? 2. So if I summarize your thinking, Wikipedia is implying that there is a "correct model" for every theory. This just seems a bit silly. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400332"> I edited my question to address this in a little more detail. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400386"> @Seub 1. G has no proof, by Godel's theorem. Thus the proof does not exist. 2. I don't think they are saying that. I was claiming that there is a "correct" model of arithmetic and arithmetical truth is well-defined (this is, I think, most peoples' belief but not philosophically bulletproof). There is certainly not generally a "correct" model of a given system of axioms any more than there's a "correct" group in group theory (your geometry example also works). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400403"> @Seub But we oftentimes write down axioms imagining we're specifying a given model, like Euclid was trying to specify Euclidean geometry. In this case, an undecidable statement means we have not fully specified it. In some systems (where Godel holds) we will never achieve our goal of pinning down every truth value by specifying axioms in a computable fashion. Whether or not that means those truth values do not exist and our more elaborate arguments and impressions that we had a model were in fact bunk is the object of controversy here. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400428"> What you are writing makes sense, but if the justification of Wikipedia's paragraph is that, after the words "truth value", it is implied "in a given model that we are imagining", it is a bit weak, don't you think? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400454"> @Seub Well when we make statements like 'this diophantine equation has a solution' or 'the continuum hypothesis is true', what do you imagine we're saying? (And also, I refer you User21820's first point that when we talk about statements having proofs in formal systems we are implicitly asserting some kind of absolute truth, at least for <span class="math-container" id="24174946" visual_id="11867"><math alttext="\Sigma_{1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math></span> sentences of arithmetic.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400500"> @spaceisdarkgreen: To add to what you said, for euclidean geometry Tarski's axiomatization (but not Euclid's or Hilbert's) was proven to be complete and consistent (in a suitable meta-system), so we have in a certain technical sense pinned down euclidean geometry. I definitely agree with your answer. Some set theorists think that ZFC has a canonical model, while others like JDH think there is no distinguished model. The issue that many people don't grasp is that we cannot avoid working in a formal system, to be able to do any mathematics at all. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5400931"> Thanks for your clarifications. I'll mark your answer as accepted but for the record, I still find that the Wikipedia text is not relevant, and that the correct statement is that "the truth value of an undecidable statement is undefined". I don't see any serious logical/mathematical objection against this, but rather (pseudo-)philosophical objections that have to do with the questionable notion of "true model". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401001"> @Seub You still haven't answered my question! Let's be more concrete and again think about Godel's canonical G for PA, which says something of the form (translated from first order arithmetic) "there does not exist a number with a certain (computable) property". What does the fact that G is undecidable in PA say about its truth value? What about the fact that the ZFC version of the same statement is provable? What about the fact that (if you believe Godel's theorem) such a number with said property does not exist? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401066"> @Seub I would introspect about *why* you're not getting any agreement that the wiki paragraph is outright wrong. I would submit that you are making at least as many interpretational choices as we are. When you say  "Undecidability in a formal system means the statement is neither true or false" you are saying that what you mean by true or false is provability in some formal system. But statements are not made in formal systems, they are made in *languages*. Is there a 'true formal system' that you are using as the basis for this decision that the statement is neither true nor false? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401128"> @spaceisdarkgreen: I am not mistaking "true" for "provable", but Gödel's completeness theorem says that "provable" is equivalent to "true in all models". Alternatively, there is a notion of "truth valuation" (on the set of formulas of a theory), and Post's tautology theorem says that a statement is provable if and only if its truth value is "True" for every valuation. Thus we have two well-defined notions of what "true" means, and their relation to decidability is very clear, by these two theorems. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401132"> @Seub Actually, I suppose from what I gather is your thinking you are defining true or false mean true or false in *every* model of a given formal system. (Which, in first order systems is the same thing as provability cause of completeness.) Again this is relative to a formal system, when the usual definition is to take true or false to mean relative to some model. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401159"> @Seub "I am not mistaking "true" for "provable"" Perhaps not, but what you are doing amounts to the same thing. Perhaps let's think about how what you are saying would work in a 2nd order system where there is no completeness theorem. In 2nd order PA with full semantics there is one unique model (which is misleading since there's much more metamathematical overhead). And yet there are undecidable statements. What does their undecidability say about their truth value in the model? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401203"> @Seub And again you're not engaging with my questions. Is G true or false? Do you at least see why someone might find 'neither' to be an bad answer? Who cares if it's false in some nonstandard models, we're talking about the natural numbers! Regarding Post, how is (the very decidable) propositional logic even relevant here? Second, these are not statements about "what true means", they are statements about being true *in every model of some system* (and its relation to provability in that system). They are not somehow reifying 'truth = truth in every model'. You said that, not Post/Godel. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401255"> @spaceisdarkgreen "and again you're not engaging my question": hey, take it easy, I address almost everything you write. I think this question confuses things more than it needs to but I'll do my best: my understanding is that G is neither "true" nor "false", in PA at least, since it is undecidable, but I don't have a problem with the idea that it is true in your favorite model of the integers. But whether this fav model is the "actual natural numbers of the real world" is beyond the scope of what logic can discuss, it seems to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401260"> @spaceisdarkgreen I agree with what you write about "what true means". From this agreement you should reach the same conclusion as me, that the relation between the decidability of a statement and its "truth" (in some/every model) is very clear, contrary to what wiki says. I respectfully find that you are the one who "confuses" the definition of "true" by introducing the notion of "true" model, or the "actual" integers, not me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401338"> @spaceisdarkgreen: Also, Post's tautology theorem about truth valuations is a theorem of first order logic, see e.g. Schoenfield's "mathematical logic" section 3.1. I'm happy to start a conversation instead of doing more comments, if you prefer. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5401402"> @Seub I think what I meant about "what true means" didn't get across. I was saying "true" typically means "true in some specified model," not "true in every model of some specified formal system." I don't understand how one can conflate these as in "some/every." (And I'll check your reference on the theorem... I just assumed cause of "tautology.") I don't have time for extended discussion right now but if this continues later we can certainly go into chat. </td></tr>
