<p>Let's say I consider the Banach–Tarski paradox unacceptable, meaning that I would rather do all my mathematics without using the axiom of choice. As my foundation, I would presumably have to use ZF, ZF plus other axioms, or an approach in which sets were not fundamental.</p> <p>Suppose that all I want is enough analysis to express all existing theories in physics. Is ZF enough? If not, then is there any attractive, utilitarian system of the form ZF+x, where x represents some other axiom(s), that does suffice, without allowing Banach-Tarski?</p> <p>Wikipedia has a list of statements that are equivalent to choice: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice#Equivalents">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice#Equivalents</a> The only one that seems obviously relevant is Blass's result that you need choice to prove that every vector space has a basis. But if all I care about is vector spaces that would actually be used in physics (probably nothing fancier than the space of functions from <span class="math-container" id="1192643" visual_id="2631"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{m}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>m</mi></msup></semantics></math></span> to <span class="math-container" id="1192644" visual_id="1662"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></semantics></math></span>), does this matter? I.e., are the spaces for which you need choice to prove the existence of a basis too pathological to be of interest to a physicist? In cases of physical interest, it seems like it would be trivial to construct a basis explicitly.</p> <p>Is Solovay's theorem relevant? I'm confused about the role played by the existence of inaccessible cardinals.</p> <p>I'm a physicist, not a mathematician, so I would appreciate answers pitched at the level of a dilettante, not that of a professional logician.</p> <p>[EDIT] André Nicolas asks: "[...] why should Banach-Tarski be unacceptable?" Fair enough. Let me try to clarify what I had in mind. The real number system contains stuff that is physically meaningless, but (a) I have a clear idea of which of its features can't mean anything physical (e.g., the distinction between rationals and irrationals), and (b) doing math in <span class="math-container" id="1192645" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℚ</mi></semantics></math></span> would be much less convenient than doing math in <span class="math-container" id="1192646" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>. Similarly, I might prefer to think of my <span class="math-container" id="1192647" visual_id="870"><math alttext="dy" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>'s and <span class="math-container" id="1192648" visual_id="12245"><math alttext="dx" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>'s as infinitesimals, and although those are unphysical, I understand what's unphysical about them, and they're convenient. But when it comes to choice, it's not obvious to me how to distinguish physically meaningful consequences from physically meaningless ones, and it's not obvious that I would lose any convenience by limiting myself to ZF.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="243307"> For a fair bit of basic analysis, Countable Choice, or Dependent Choice, is enough. We really want, for example, sequential convergence in the reals to be equivalent to convergence. And a *basis* in the algebraic sense is not usually what we need for infinite dimensional spaces.  But why should Banach-Tarski be unacceptable? It involves really weird sets that presumably would not show up in models from Physics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243398"> @Ben: _I_ think the space of smooth functions <span class="math-container" id="1192649" visual_id="135859"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>m</mi></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span> is _very_ fancy, and I'm a mathematician! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="708878"> By "basis" I assume you mean a Hamel basis (so every element in the vector space is a finite linear combination of basis elements).  I'm not sure how badly you need Hamel bases in mathematical physics, and in much of mathematical analysis and PDE, for that matter. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1743298"> It's worth noting that the axiom of dependent choice is far more different from the full axiom of choice than most people think. The axiom of dependent choice follows naturally from considering objects generated by an algorithm that is allowed to instantiate existentially quantified objects at any point. Even without the axiom that gives an infinite set (but there are still infinite classes), this is enough for mathematics that applies to the real world (as is currently known), since algorithms can describe any definable process and the real world doesn't seem to have any infinite object. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1885518"> Feferman has, I think, spent quite a bit of intellectual effort on just this question; see, for example, http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/psa1992.pdf. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4973046"> The axiom of choice gets a lot of undeserved negative press. It is actually a *theorem* of ZF plus the assumption that the universe consists entirely of sets you can construct. So, before you can even consider rejecting choice, you must first assert the existence of an unconstructible set! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4989646"> Also, insofar as we call real numbers "physical", there is nothing unphysical about infinitesimals -- analysis in the standard and nonstandard models are not just 'physically' indistinguishable from one another, they are *theoretically* indistinguishable as well. The only way we can even make sense of the idea that the nonstandard model has infinitesimals is if we allow ourselves to work with both the standard *and* nonstandard models simultaneously, and we see the nonstandard models has positive reals of magnitude smaller than any appearing in the standard model. </td></tr>

<p>Blass's theorem is a very strong one indeed. If the axiom of choice does not hold then there is a vector space without a basis. It is unusual to be able and tell which vector space it is (unless assuming more, or constructing the model directly).</p> <p>In particular, finite dimensional vector spaces <em>always</em> have a basis, since such basis is finite and thus completely definable in the universe.</p> <p>Most of the basic analysis would require the axiom of countable choice, or the axiom of dependent choice. Both would be enough for almost every theorem you learn in basic calculus class - but neither is enough for Banach-Tarski. You may wish to add something like the ultrafilter lemma, however once there is a free ultrafilter over <span class="math-container" id="1192657" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span> there are unmeasurable sets - if that would bother you.</p> <p>In general to prove that a space has a basis may require <em>some</em> choice, for example <span class="math-container" id="1192658" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> as a vector space over <span class="math-container" id="1192659" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℚ</mi></semantics></math></span> requires choice. If however your interest is in finitely dimensional vector spaces then you can relax, since those would be fine regardless to the axiom of choice. There are infinitely dimensional spaces which have explicit basis as well, for example all the infinite sequences which are eventually zero.</p> <p>Once you go beyond that it becomes harder and harder to produce a basis without the axiom of choice, but your needs might not go that far.</p> <p>By Solovay's theorem I suppose you mean his model in which every set is measurable, and such. This is irrelevant, and in fact it holds a horrible secret:</p> <p>In Solovay's model we can cut <span class="math-container" id="1192660" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> into <em>more</em> parts then it has elements. Namely, we can cut <span class="math-container" id="1192661" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> into non-empty parts and have <strong>more</strong> parts than real numbers. This sort of partition might sound very bizarre and pathological, much like the Banach-Tarski paradox. However such partitions can be a handful in some parts of set  theory.</p> <hr/> <p>You may want to think that you're screwed basing yourself on ZF either way, but the problem is that mathematics almost always have this way to sting you in the back, no matter how you put it. You can simply put "new limitations" (e.g. limit yourself to measurable sets, which still gives you a rich and fulfilling world) and just use mathematics as you first wanted.</p> <p>One of the least known facts about choice is that the definitions of continuity: <span class="math-container" id="1192662" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> and sequential continuity are <em>not</em> equivalent without some choice. If you have used this before, you have used the axiom of choice.</p> <p>The point above is that the axiom of choice simply allows us to control <em>many</em> infinitary processes in a very simple way. While physics itself does not <em>really</em> talk about infinite processes (at least not as far as I know) you should be able to get away from that if you ditch the axiom of choice. However you may want to keep enough of it to ensure that what you have approximated with finite parts is continuously carried over to the limit point. This is in its essence the principle of dependent choice (and to a lesser extent the axiom of countable choice).</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Something to Read:</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/91222/finite-dimensional-subspaces-of-a-linear-space/91229#91229">Finite dimensional subspaces of a linear space</a></li> <li><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/64237/finite-choice-without-ac/64239#64239">Finite choice without AC</a></li> <li><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/22927/why-worry-about-the-axiom-of-choice">Why worry about the axiom of choice?</a></li> <li><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/27428/does-the-axiom-of-choice-or-any-other-optional-set-theory-axiom-have-real-wor">Does the Axiom of Choice (or any other “optional” set theory axiom) have real-world consequences?

<tr><td comment_id="243334"> Nice answer. But I'm confused by the final remark about Solovay. If I'm understanding correctly, then we're writing <span class="math-container" id="1192663" visual_id="8497896"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}=\cup A_{\alpha}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>∪</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>α</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, where the A are disjoint, and the cardinality of <span class="math-container" id="1192664" visual_id="91261"><math alttext="\{A_{\alpha}\}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>α</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> is less than the cardinality of <span class="math-container" id="1192685" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>. If you had choice, you could use it to pick a member of each A and map it to that A. This function would be one-to-one, contradicting your statement. So is you statement that the cardinality of <span class="math-container" id="1192666" visual_id="15895"><math alttext="\{A\}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> is less than the cardinality of the reals, or merely that we can't *prove* in ZF that it's not less? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243335"> Ben, what I am saying is that one can write <span class="math-container" id="1192667" visual_id="8497897"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}=\bigcup\{A_{i}\mid i\in I\}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo largeop="true" mathsize="160%" stretchy="false" symmetric="true">⋃</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>∣</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, where <span class="math-container" id="1192668" visual_id="4286"><math alttext="A_{i}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></semantics></math></span>'s are disjoint, nonempty and <span class="math-container" id="1192669" visual_id="431940"><math alttext="|I|&gt;|\mathbb{R}|" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo><mi>I</mi><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo><mi>ℝ</mi><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243345"> OK, so is one of the following true? (1) My reasoning above about the one-to-one function is incorrect. (2) The example you refer to is a counterexample to the axiom of choice within this model -- in which case all I think the example demonstrates is that if you don't assume choice, choice doesn't necessarily hold. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243353"> In a manner very fitting to the sense of irony this example carries with it, neither the options you gave is true. The point I was trying to make is that you have a problem with the Banach-Tarski paradox, but this is much much worse. You can actually cut something into more parts than elements. This only demonstrates that if you let go of the axiom of choice simply because Banach-Tarski is hold you back then there is going to be a different paradoxical snake to bite you. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243364"> Thanks for the links to the other questions. But, sorry, you've lost me completely re Solovay. If choice is independent of ZF, then it doesn't surprise me if there are models of ZF in which there are counterexamples to choice. If there is more to what you're saying than this, then I don't understand what it is. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243365"> Ben, of course that if the axiom of choice does not hold then there are counterexamples to it. The point in my remark on Solovay's model is that if Banach-Tarski serves as a pitching point *against* the axiom of choice since the decomposition is paradoxical, I cannot imagine how you can calmly accept slicing <span class="math-container" id="1192670" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> into more parts than elements! Furthermore, in this model every part is measurable!! When I first heard this, I shook my head in disbelief. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243429"> @Asaf This is very interesting. However, is it possible to avoid both the Banach-Tarski paradox and the paradox in the Solovay model you just mentioned, perhaps allowing countable choice, so that one can still do basic calculus? This seems like a nice compromise (if it is possible). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243449"> @Emilio: Anyone for the Axiom of Determinateness (AD)? It has interesting consequences. One issue (among many) is plausibility. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243483"> @André they all seem very plausible to start with, and then contradict each other and imply horrible paradoxes! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243503"> @Asaf: I see. The thing is, just because a particular theory T has a particular model M with properties we don't believe, that doesn't mean that T is a bad theory. If T is "all poodles are dogs," and M is a model of T in which George W. Bush was a good president, that isn't evidence that T is a bad theory. Similarly, the existence of nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic doesn't tell me that Peano arithmetic is a poor way of formalizing our notions about the natural numbers. To the extent that AC sounds reasonable when you first hear it, any theory without AC admits strange models. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243539"> @AndréNicolas: I do not understand your concern on plausibility. Care to expand? The reason why I don't know what you mean is that the axiom of determinacy is simply *true* (not just consistent) in several inner models, under assumptions of large cardinals in the universe. Now, there are absolutely no *mathematical* arguments against large cardinals (see http://mathoverflow.net/questions/44095/arguments-against-large-cardinals/44185#44185). Instead, they are routinely adopted by most modern set theorists as part of the basic assumptions we start with. So plausibility as a concern is strange. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243595"> @Andres Calcedo: I have an interest in AD, at least in the sense that I published a minor paper that uses it. But, perhaps only because of familiarity, I tend to view full AC as true. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243702"> @Emilio: My point is that there will always be some "paradox". Be it Banach-Tarski; or this horrid decomposition; or worse. If you want to accept one "paradox" over the other, then it doesn't really matter and you can just use the one which is the most convenient (in this case, just ZFC). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243703"> @Ben: See my previous comment to Emilio. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243772"> @Asaf If I understand correctly though, the Banach-Tarski paradox is a Theorem in ZFC, but the paradoxical decomposition you are referring to is only consistent with ZF. So if one's goal is to use a theory in which no paradoxes are actually *theorems*, one could renounce the full AC; maybe allowing countable choice actually rules out "Solovay's paradox" altogether. Is this reasoning right? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="243776"> @Emilio: The Banach-Tarski is indeed a theorem of ZFC, the "paradoxes" I refer to are theorems of ZF+[various non-AC assertions]. The point is that either you will have *no choice* and thus some paradox will rise - or that you'll have *enough choice* for some paradox to rise. Either way, you're stuck with paradoxes. Regardless to that, none of them are actually important for doing mathematics (they just guide you that you must walk carefully between the available definitions), so there's no point in "renouncing choice" for the sake of no Banach-Tarski. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1576236"> @AsafKaragila: You are forgetting the _obvious_ paradox that choice is incompatible with the statement "consider this randomly chosen real number". This is a paradox which makes it forbidden to talk about random numbers with specific values! Instead, you have to talk about randomly chosen things as second-class objects in the universe, where certain operations cannot be defined. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1576363"> @AsafKaragila: Downvoted, because of the statement that "in Solovay's model you can decompose R into more parts than it has elements". This is using the ridiculous idea that just because you can't inject aleph-1 into R that aleph-1 somehow has "more elements" than R. Not true, it doesn't, it is simply incomparable. The ordinal tower is separated conceptually from the powersets in Solovay model, and you can't compare the two in size at all. The reals are enormously large, and the ordinals are much smaller, but to demonstrate this by embedding you have to first take the ordinals to be countable. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1576663"> @Ron: You can **PROVABLY** map <span class="math-container" id="1192675" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> onto <span class="math-container" id="1192676" visual_id="54277"><math alttext="\omega_{1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>ω</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math></span>.

If you have one that is incomparable over injective functions, then you have one which is "larger" over injective functions by just adding <span class="math-container" id="1192685" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>-many elements to the partition. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5648690"> @Jason: Then I really have no idea what is the point you're trying to make with your comment. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5649297"> @AsafKaragila The point is it's a rather trivial and intuitive consequence, not a very strong argument. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5649925"> @Jason: Can we skip the pronoun game? What are you talking about? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5650074"> @AsafKaragila  The existence of partitions with "more" elements via injections is a rather trivial and intuitive consequence of partitions which are incomparable to <span class="math-container" id="1192685" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> under injections. For this reason, using such a partition's existence as an argument against Solovay's model is not very strong. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5650121"> @Jason: Then your intuition is quite unique, I must say. I'm still not used to this "intuitively", having spent the last seven years working a lot in choiceless settings. Kudos. In any case, my point is that the Banach–Tarski theorem cannot be used as an argument against choice, as a whole, since in its absence, you get a whole other kind of weird partitions. But again, if you find this intuitive, good for you, then </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5652302"> @AsafKaragila The point I was trying to make is that it's a very simple consequence of an incomparable partition (which ought to exist). It's just that injections are a very poor means of talking about more, since we let <span class="math-container" id="1192685" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> inject by just adding a copy of <span class="math-container" id="1192685" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> into the partition. It's just putting A into A + B, where there's no relation between A and B. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5652669"> @Jason: The "ought to exist" and the "intuitive" (from previous comments) are the reasons I find your blasé attitude so odd. Yes, these things exist in Solovay's model, and yes if one has done enough of these proofs it's even easy to see why. But from here to intuitive there is a ***long*** way. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5655760"> @AsafKaragila The ought here is in regard to models which don't have non-measurable sets. We don't expect partitions like R/Q to be a subset of R (in a nice way), nor R a subset of them, so if that were true for some partition, we'd get a 'larger' partition by simple adding R many elements. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5655911"> @Jason: This will be my last comment, because we are really going at it like two broken records. You claim that it's very intuitive that a set can be partitioned into more non-empty sets than it has elements. Kudos for you. You are one in a billion. All that I am claiming is that ***in my opinion*** arguing that Banach–Tarski is a reason to abandon choice is silly, since you get a weird partition of the reals instead of the BT partition of <span class="math-container" id="1192686" visual_id="2209"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{3}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></semantics></math></span>. Clearly you disagree. I hope you move to choiceless set theory soon, since your intuition seems to be impeccable. See you at some conference... </td></tr>
