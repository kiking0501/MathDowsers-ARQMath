                        <p>My dilemma has been that I am confused on how we make mathematical assumptions in WORD problems. Suppose you are given a related-rates word problem. </p>  <p><strong>(Q#) Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute. Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.</strong></p>  <p>My question is how do you figure out if there is a leak located in the balloon? The author doesnt say anything about there being a leak or there NOT being a leak. </p>  <p>**So, how do you determine if there is a hole in the balloon, from which AIR LEAVES?? ** Keep in mind that this is communication. Could it perhaps experience. Because of how you LEARN word problems? </p>  <p><strong>Or is the answer just that the METHOD of solving word problems is this??</strong></p>  <p>Thank you very much =) </p>

                        <p>How do you know the material of the balloon will continue to hold until it reaches a radius of two feet?</p>  <p>How do you know the pump doesn't fail before that point?</p>  <p>How do you know there isn't a mischievous little kid waiting to poke the balloon with a needle before it reaches that point?</p>  <p>etc. etc.</p>  <p>These are all implicit assumptions. Not every possibility can be explicitly stated. There is no reason to presuppose a leak when it's not even been hinted at by the question.</p>  <p>Actually, a MUCH more obvious assumption in this question is that the balloon is a perfect sphere. If you think just a little about it, it's almost impossibly practical to have a "real-life" balloon that remains a perfect sphere throughout filling. For one thing, there has to be an inlet for the air that stretches uniformly while maintaining a perfect seal around the pump nozzle, which implies that the pump nozzle itself has to be expanding to fill the hole. Again, this is an assumption that one makes for simplicity. The question would become very difficult to handle if you tried analyzing a realistic balloon.</p>
