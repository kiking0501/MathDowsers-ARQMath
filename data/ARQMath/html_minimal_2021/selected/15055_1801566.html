<p>In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls?</p> <p>I just dipped into a book, <em>The Drunkard's Walk - How Randomness Rules Our Lives</em>, by Leonard Mlodinow, Vintage Books, 2008. On p.107 Mlodinow says the chances are 1 in 3. </p> <p>It seems obvious to me that the chances are 1 in 2. Am I correct? Is this not exactly analogous to having a bowl with an infinite number of marbles, half black and half red? Without looking I draw out a black marble. The probability of the second marble I draw being black is 1/2.</p>

I know they have 2 kids. One of them, a girl, comes into the room. The probability that the 2nd kid is also a girl is 1/2, no?   Or let's say my wife and I have our first child, a girl. The probability that the next child we have will also be a girl is 1/2, no? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="33072"> In the second case, yes; in the first case, I think the answer is also yes (given that one of the two children walk with equal probability).
