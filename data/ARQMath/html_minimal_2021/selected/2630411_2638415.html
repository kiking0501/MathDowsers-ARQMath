<p>I have a set of axis aligned rectangles. When two rectangles overlap (partly or completely), they can be merged into their common bounding box. This process works recursively.</p> <p>Detecting all overlaps and using union-find to form groups, which you merge <em>in the end</em> will not work, because the merging of two rectangles covers a larger area and can create new overlaps. (In the figure below, after the two overlapping rectangles have been merged, a new overlap appears.)</p> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FsD1B.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FsD1B.png"/></a></p> <p>As in my case the number of rectangles is moderate (say <span class="math-container" id="24317173" visual_id="2160989"><math alttext="N&lt;100" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>), a brute force solution is usable (try all pairs and if an overlap is found, merge and restart from the beginning). Anyway I would like to reduce the complexity, which is probably <span class="math-container" id="24317174" visual_id="357869"><math alttext="O(N^{3})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi>N</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> in the worst case.</p> <p>Any suggestion how to improve this ?</p>

<p>I think a line sweep algorithm will perform well.</p> <p>The state of the sweep is a set of disjoint rectangles, initially empty. </p> <p>When you see a rectangle, merge it with the rectangles in the list.</p> <p>If you need, you can keep the list ordered by <span class="math-container" id="24317200" visual_id="264434"><math alttext="y_{\min}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>min</mi></msub></semantics></math></span>.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="5448915"> The difficulty with a sweep line is that a merge can cause an already swept rectangle to become overlapped. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5448919"> @YvesDaoust, yes, I see that point, which you already made in the question. That's unavoidable. But a sweep line will tend to keep complexity down for most scenes. I haven't tested it, though. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5448928"> I fear that this phenomenon completely breaks the sweeping trick. Because you don't know when you can remove a rectangle from the list. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5448932"> @YvesDaoust, you remove a rectangle for the queue when it's first seen and merged into the list. Or perhaps we're talking about different problems. Anyway, it's just an idea. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5449078"> Yep, so unmerged rectangles stay forever. </td></tr>
