<div id="question" question_id="948171">
<p>A question (by a fellow CS student taking a first course in calculus, presumably after the lecture in which continuity was introduced: was as follows.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the real, physical world, we deal with numbers that are sort of “finite” or “discrete” by their nature; there's no such thing as a perfect circle in the physical world. In CS, we model computers with discrete mathematics and it’s enough. So why real analysis? Why concepts like continuity and “completeness” of real numbers are useful? Why do we need them?</p> </blockquote> <p>I found Math.se has lots of questions for similar “concrete” justifications for <em>complex</em> numbers and great answers for them, but I didn’t really manage to find similar for this. The question <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/51316/are-all-numbers-real-numbers">Are all numbers real numbers?</a> is related, but I’m not sure it’s exactly what I’m looking for.</p> <p>My attempt at an answer was along the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>Are we content with the length of the side of a square that has area of 2 units remaining a undefined number, even if we never manage find such a square?</p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <p>Calculus and real analysis provide results that are useful even if in numerical calculations we use finite approximations. To really understand what's going on, we want it to be rigorous.</p> </blockquote> <p>but I’m not sure if I was persuasive enough. Any better ideas?</p>

It's not much of a leap to realize that, conversely, computations utilizing the continuum may approximate discrete things, and indeed, one can observe this come up innumerable times in the relevant branches of mathematics.

Draw a 1cm^2 square instead (or in inches). A unit square is something concrete and definitely exist. Now, draw the diagonal line that connects opposing corners.

<p>As a one who learns Computer Science and Mathematics (just because I love to make my own video games) I want tell you that: </p> <p>Even though computer science is all discrete, Continuous mathematics stays true in discrete cases like computer science.</p> <p>For example suppose that you want to move a bird on screen from point <span class="math-container" id="9118458" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> to point <span class="math-container" id="9118459" visual_id="599"><math alttext="B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi></semantics></math></span> on the graph of the function <span class="math-container" id="9118460" visual_id="15399"><math alttext="f(x)=\frac{\sin x}{x}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mi>x</mi></mfrac></mrow></semantics></math></span>. What can you do when <span class="math-container" id="9118461" visual_id="2056"><math alttext="x=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>? How can you know that <span class="math-container" id="9118462" visual_id="1"><math alttext="f" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>f</mi></semantics></math></span> can be defined at <span class="math-container" id="9118463" visual_id="2056"><math alttext="x=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> in a way that removes the discontinuity without using the squeeze theorem? (By the way better movement can be done using the arc length formula which invites even more calculus) What if you want to change the bird' s rotation so that the bird will be 'tangent' to the curve? The derivative comes. There are even more extreme cases where you'll need to use Real Analysis to analyze graph of functions (and to actually use <span class="math-container" id="9118464" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definition of limits).</p> <p>That's  was a very simple example. There are more complex examples, How can your make water simulation that interacts with your bird so that if your bird touches the water or dives into the water, ripples will start (not ripples that are some simple animation, but ripples that are calculated using the impact force on the water)? You'll need to use Vector Fields and Fluid Mechanics and a lot of it which is of course continuous mathematics.</p> <p>This means that continuous mathematics stays true in discrete cases (like pixels on screen).</p> <p>I think one of the best ways to see where continuous mathematics is important in computer science is to do stuff that invites its use like Computer Graphics, Audio Processing, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Physics Programming, Machine Learning, Computational Geometry, Game Development (which is actually a mix of Computer Graphics, Computational Geometry, Artificial Intelligence and Physics Programming and you can even add Computer Vision and Audio Processing for different types of game interactions).</p> <p>Try to build a small computer game and tell me how can you move your objects on screen without continuous mathematics?</p> <p>Now what about complex analysis? </p>
