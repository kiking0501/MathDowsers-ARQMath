<p>For a year or two I've been doing/learning statistics using books written both for engineers and semi-professionals. I know how to apply most of the theory that statisticians use on job, but I'm still searching for answers why the theory behind statistics is the way it is. </p> <p>In books it is written when to use an <span class="math-container" id="6319735" visual_id="75"><math alttext="F" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>F</mi></semantics></math></span>-test, <span class="math-container" id="6319736" visual_id="297"><math alttext="t" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>t</mi></semantics></math></span>-test or <span class="math-container" id="6319737" visual_id="26276"><math alttext="X^{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> (Chi-Square) etc. to solve problems, but the reason why these tests are used are never stated and the theory behind them is completely left out.</p> <p>Why are the theory that goes behind statistics so esoteric (hidden) ? Is it because it is very hard to understand ? Why are the theory / reasons for using these tests not shown in books ? Could someone tell me where to look up the theory, since doing something where you don't have the "background" knowledge seems unappealing to me.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="1309551"> There is nothing hidden here -but as you said you have been exposed to books for "engineers and semi-professionals", i.e. for people that are mainly interested in how to apply the theory. You should obviously start by looking up books that target students of statistics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1309559"> Can you recommend some ? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1309578"> Only from the econometrics field. The books by Aris Spanos "Statistical Foundations of Econometric Modelling" , or "Probability Theory and Statistical Inference: Econometric Modelling with Observational Data", (the main difference is that the first treats much more extensively the linear regression model) I believe contain very helpful expositions of the theoretical foundations of applied statistics (of course having econometricians in mind). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1309779"> So these books give the background information on these statistical tests ? - Explain why they are defined how they are and what lay behind the ideas of the definitions ? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1309797"> Yes, but much more than that, so they are maybe an "overkill" if you only need to get some basic facts behind t- and F- tests. </td></tr>

<p>The primary reason for what you have observed in your studies is that deriving the appropriate sampling distribution for a particular test statistic is in general not an easy thing to do, but once known, it need not be derived again in order for the result to be applied in practice.</p> <p>By analogy, this is a bit like calculus versus real analysis:  in calculus, we are primarily concerned with how to compute integrals, derivatives, limits, and series expansions, but in real analysis, we learn about the mathematical principles that make such operations rigorous (e.g., properties of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals, uniform continuity, etc).</p> <p>So, if you consult any reasonably comprehensive text in mathematical statistics (as opposed to applied statistics), then you should find the relevant proofs for the F-test, t-test, chi-squared test, and so forth.  Some of the simpler tests such as the Z-test are easy enough to illustrate in the applied texts.  You will encounter more advanced concepts such as the delta method, asymptotic convergence, and Satterwaithe's approximation, because some of these tests apply only to large sample sizes because the exact sampling distribution is not "simple."</p>

<tr><td comment_id="1311760"> The only thing to be found in mathematical statistical texts are proofs that certain indicators follow a given probability law. To take your example, I think Nicolas is not interested in computing integral or derivative, nor is he interested in the proofs but only the simple fact that the first measure an area and the second a tangent. </td></tr>
