                        <p>for a long time in the subjects of the university I learned to use complex numbers, to do derivatives, to sum series, and a lot more of things ...</p>  <p>To this day I use them, but as a tool, without really understanding the why of things, almost all the books I have used to learn, only teach you the method and tell you much above what is or is, but They do not explain why.</p>  <p>Some time ago I saw some pretty good books for statistics, but I would like to know if you know of a book that explains things well conceptually for other areas like calculation.</p>  <p>Any favorite book</p>

Also, evoking those questions too soon is not so easy (learning abstract algebra or functional analysis before real analysis is not really possible) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4337238"> Hi eslop, by 'calculation' do you mean caculus? </td></tr>

                        <p>It sounds like you want a real analysis book, like Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis.</p>  <p>You start off by assuming you know what the rationals are, then the real numbers. Then, proving a bunch of properties of real numbers, then rigorously defining things like continuity, differentiability, sums, integrability, etc. </p>

Moreover, Rudin's book would be challenging for a newcomer - to say nothing of it being exclusively dedicated to analysis. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4337242"> @Chris - thanks, its been a while. The highlighted topics would be covered in a first analysis course though. </td></tr>
