<p>Complex numbers involve the square root of negative one, and most non-mathematicians find it hard to accept that such a number is meaningful. In contrast, they feel that real numbers have an obvious and intuitive meaning. What's the best way to explain <strong>to a non-mathematician</strong> that complex numbers are necessary and meaningful, in the same way that real numbers are?</p> <p>This is not a Platonic question about the reality of mathematics, or whether abstractions are as real as physical entities, but an attempt to bridge a comprehension gap that many people experience when encountering complex numbers for the first time. The wording, although provocative, is deliberately designed to match the way that many people actually ask this question.</p>

<p>Complex numbers are the final step in a sequence of increasingly "unreal" extensions to the number system that humans have found it necessary to add over the centuries in order to express significant numerical concepts.</p> <p>The first such "unreal number" was zero, back in the mists of time. It seems obvious to us now, but it must have seemed strange at first. How can the number of sheep I have be zero, when I don't actually have any sheep?</p> <p>Negative numbers are the next most obvious addition to the family of numbers. But what does it mean to have -2 apples? If I have 3 apples and you have 5, it's convenient to be able to say that I have -2 more apples than you. Even so, during the middle ages many mathematicians were very uncomfortable with the idea of negative numbers and tried to arrange their equations so that they didn't occur.</p> <p>Rationals (fractions) seem real enough, since I'm happy to have 2/5 of a pizza. However, this is not the number of pizzas that I have, just a ratio between 0 and 1 pizzas, and so is further removed from the concept of counting.</p> <p>More significant philosophical problems problems arose when irrational numbers were first discovered by the classical Greeks. They were astonished when Euclid (or one of his predecessors) proved that the diagonal of a unit square could not be represented by ratio of two integers. This was such an outrageous idea to them that they called these numbers "irrational". However, they couldn't easily deny their existence since they have a direct geometric representation.</p> <p>Irrational numbers were first understood as the solutions to algebraic equations such as x^2 = 2 but this still doesn't cover all the possible numbers that we need. For example, the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference is π and so has a direct geometric representation. However, in 1882 π was proved to be transcendental, meaning that it can't be defined as the solution to a specific algebraic equation. This begins to seem a lot less "real", especially when you consider that there are many important transcendental numbers that, unlike π, don't have a geometric interpretation.</p> <p>There are of course many algebraic equations that don't have a solution even among the irrational numbers, and in some ways there's no reason why they should. However, when 16th century mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano began working on solutions to cubic equations they found that the square roots of negative numbers began cropping up very naturally in their procedures, even though the solutions themselves were purely real. This eventually led people to explore the arithmetic of complex numbers and they were surprised to find that it produced a consistent and beautiful theory.</p> <p>However, complex numbers don't have such an intuitively obvious geometrical meaning as the numbers that came before. They are typically represented graphically as points in the 2D plane, and the rules of addition and multiplication are equivalent to certain operations on lengths and angles, but those operations aren't driven by geometrical necessity in quite the way that squares and circles are. Even so, complex numbers are a perfect representation for various physical phenomena such as the state of particles in quantum mechanics and the behaviour of varying currents in electrical circuits. They are also very useful for reducing the cost of computation in 3D computer graphics.</p> <p>The really special thing about complex numbers, though, is that they are the end of this journey that has been going on for millenia. There is no need to invent further number systems to provide solutions to problems expressed in terms of complex numbers because now every non-contradictory equation, algebraic or transcendental, has a solution within the complex numbers. They are a self-sufficient, consistent system.</p> <p>Physicists have been breaking matter down into smaller and smaller particles over the years. Molecules, atoms, nuclei, protons, quarks. When will the process stop? For several decades it was felt that quarks could be the final, indivisible particle. However, new theoretical frameworks such as string theory are suggesting that there may be more fundamental entities than quarks. Because physics ultimately relies on experimental verification, we can never be sure that there aren't going to be more steps in the sequence.</p> <p>In mathematics, however, we can prove things for all time. Complex numbers are the final step in the sequence, the numbers that we have been reaching for since before the beginning of recorded history. Every other number system is just a subset of the complex numbers, just a part of the true picture. Complex numbers are the real thing.</p>

For example, modular arithmetic (say, adding and multiplying mod 5) can not be viewed as a subset of the complex numbers.  In modular arithmetic 1 added to itself enough times gives you 0 and that doesn't happen in C.
