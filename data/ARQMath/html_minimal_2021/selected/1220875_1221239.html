<div id="question" question_id="1220875">
<p>One of my friends was asking me about tertiary level mathematics as opposed to high school mathematics, and naturally the topic of rigour came up.</p> <p>To provide him with a brief glimpse as to the difference, I said the following.</p> <blockquote> <p>In high school, you were taught that the area of a rectangle is <span class="math-container" id="11416624" visual_id="2203"><math alttext="ab" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>   where <span class="math-container" id="11416625" visual_id="159"><math alttext="a" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi></semantics></math></span> is the breadth and <span class="math-container" id="11416626" visual_id="368"><math alttext="b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>b</mi></semantics></math></span> is the height. You can physically see   this by constructing an <span class="math-container" id="11416627" visual_id="16118"><math alttext="a\times b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> grid and counting the squares it   forms, provided <span class="math-container" id="11416628" visual_id="159"><math alttext="a" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="11416629" visual_id="368"><math alttext="b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>b</mi></semantics></math></span> are integers.</p> </blockquote> <p>He had agreed and said that it was "obvious" that the area of a rectangle was <span class="math-container" id="11416630" visual_id="2203"><math alttext="ab" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. I then responded with:</p> <blockquote> <p>What is the area of a rectangle with dimensions <span class="math-container" id="11416631" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span> by <span class="math-container" id="11416632" visual_id="700"><math alttext="\sqrt{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></semantics></math></span>?</p> </blockquote> <p>He immediately just said <span class="math-container" id="11416633" visual_id="437986"><math alttext="\pi\sqrt{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span>, and then I responded with one of the most common questions in mathematics:</p> <blockquote> <p>How do you know that for sure?</p> </blockquote> <p>I had said that it intuitively works for integer values of <span class="math-container" id="11416634" visual_id="159"><math alttext="a" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="11416635" visual_id="368"><math alttext="b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>b</mi></semantics></math></span>, but how do we KNOW for sure that it works for irrational values of <span class="math-container" id="11416636" visual_id="159"><math alttext="a" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="11416637" visual_id="368"><math alttext="b" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>b</mi></semantics></math></span>? Then I used that as a gateway to explain that in tertiary level mathematics we don't assume such things. There is no "It is clearly true for these easy-to-understand integers, so therefore it is true for all real values" and that <strong>everything</strong> must be proven.</p> <p>He then asked me something that I had no answer to:</p> <blockquote> <p>I get that we cannot assume these kinds of things, but has there ever been an occasion where an assumption or a lack of rigour has killed someone before?</p> </blockquote> <p>I am sure that there may exist an example floating somewhere in history, but I cannot think of any. </p> <p>Do you know of one?</p> <p><strong>EDIT: Cheers to starsplusplus</strong></p> <p>A lot of really great responses! However, the majority of them don't quite fit the definition of 'rigour' in the mathematical sense, which is vastly different to the common English term. See <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/170221/what-exactly-is-mathematical-rigor">this</a>. Many of the answers provided so far have been accidents/deaths caused by a lack of what I feel to be more like <em>procedural rigour</em> as opposed to <em>mathematical rigour</em>.</p> <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p> <p>It seems like further clarification is needed regarding what I'm looking for in a response. I was looking for an example of where an individual(s) did something that was mathematically incorrect (not a trivial computational error though) that had a consequence which led to the death of one or more people. So, what do I mean by something mathematically incorrect that isn't a trivial computational error? </p> <p><strong>Example of something I'm looking for:</strong></p> <p>Say somebody is part of programming or working out the math behind a missile firing mechanism. In part of their computations, they did one of the following which yielded an incorrect value. This incorrect value caused the missile to fly out of control and cause the death of one or more person(s).</p> <ul> <li>Exchanged a summation with an integral unjustifiably</li> <li>Needed to use two sequence of numbers that always yielded relatively prime numbers. They used a computer but it didn't find any counter examples, so the programmer assumed that the formula always yields relatively prime integers. However, the counter example lies at <span class="math-container" id="11416638" visual_id="8676406"><math alttext="n=99999999999999999999999999" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>99999999999999999999999999</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>, beyond reasonable computational time.</li> <li>The limit of a series was to be used at some point in the computations. To calculate it, the person re-arranged terms however they liked and then found a limit. But the series didn't converge absolutely so they could have gotten any value. </li> </ul>

<tr><td comment_id="2483844"> Wouldn't any fatal mistake due to failure to stick to a procedure count as "death by lack of rigour"? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2483848"> From a literal standpoint, yes! But I am referring to the rigour specially in the context of Mathematics. I've edited the title to clear things up. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2484534"> While not about fatal mistakes, things like the Monty Hall problem or "after 5 reds in roulette, is black more likely next?" can be good examples to use to explain the importance of mathematical rigor. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2484794"> Should this question be on [HSM.SE]? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2485547"> Looking at David Richerby's claims that none of these are mathematical rigor issues leads to a philosophical question: if someone assumes a mathematically rigorous proof exists when one does not, and acts on that assumption and dies, do we blame the lack of mathematical rigor, or the assumption? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2485557"> One thing to keep in mind is that before rigour, nothing at all worked! So they are a lot of people who wouldn't exist right now if it wasn't for mathematical rigour, but it is hard to directly pin point which part. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2485834"> @PyRulez: Your comment sounds absurd on the face of it, which makes me curious to know what you really meant. You *can't*, surely, have meant that math was completely non-functional before the development of rigorous analytical methods, largely in the last few centuries? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2485925"> I think your example is very bad. If you want to make the point that intuition is fallible, you should give an example where intuition is actually wrong (there are plenty), and then show that it is wrong (by at least giving a counter example), instead of framing rigor as some weird quirk that you personally demand. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2486220"> I can't find a source, but my electronics engineering teacher told us this story: a circuit board controlling a roller coaster was not adequately bypassed (the power rail did not have enough capacitors to smooth out ripples) which ultimately resulted in the death of a child when the "on deck" carts entered the loading zone prematurely and rammed the carts which had people getting out of them. The kid was knocked over and then ran over.  Bypassing the power circuit on a board is a known problem and can easily be solved with mathematical rigour </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2486479"> @portforwardpodcast that would be a lack of engineering rigour, not mathematical. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2487631"> Hmm, it seems like most if not all of the examples given below are "someone did check things carefully enough", which is an example of rigor in the conventional sense, not the mathematical sense. OF COURSE there have been many times when mistakes in calculations have caused deaths. But I think a "right" answer to this question would be something more on the order of: "Someone assumed that a formula applied to real numbers just because it applied to integers, and this turned out to be wrong because in fact ..." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488072"> @Jay What about my example? The Pythagoreans clearly did not get it right. To use your phrasing: "The Pythagoreans assumed magnitudes were commensurable, but this turned out to be wrong because, in fact, ..." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488106"> @NathanTuggy Okay, I guess that is a bit of an exagerration. Progress is definitely faster now. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488150"> You're not quite right that we have to prove the area formula for a rectangle.  Area is something that's tricky to define properly, but we often start by *defining* the area of a rectangle to be the product of its side lengths, at least for certain rectangles - this is then used as a basis to define area more generally.  You have to start somewhere. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488487"> It's going to be very hard to find examples because in most cases where someone's life rides on math the system will be tested unmanned first.  The error will become apparent before anyone is in danger.  However, Alan's answer about armoring airplanes I think qualifies. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488819"> Maybe mathematical rigor can sometimes even be more harmful than the lack of it. You all know the joke: A biologist, a physicist, and a mathematician travel by train and see a black sheep. The biologist says "Oh, apparently the sheep in this country are all black". The physicist: "No, we can only say that at least *one* sheep in this country is black". The mathmatician slowly shakes her head and slowly says "At least one sheep is black on at least side". - Such rigor may in fact be too much for many applications </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489100"> Since almost every answer has a "That's not mathematical rigour, that's [something else]" comment on it, I think you should edit your question to give a rigorous definition of rigour. Or maybe [link to this question](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/170221/what-exactly-is-mathematical-rigor). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489157"> im stuck with first part , second doesnt interest me , how could you assume a product of irrational dimentions cant be applied in geometry ? im not really understanding your assumption. of course if we deal with <span class="math-container" id="11416692" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span> as a decimal number of 3,14 its erronous calculation indeed , but, if we let it abstract without concretising it on a paper, it remains workful !! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489361"> @starsplusplus I agree--that's why I just voted to close as "unclear what you're asking." I thought my answer sufficiently answered the question, but everyone else who answered feels the same way of course. There needs to be some clarification. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489364"> We're not assuming that the product of irrationals can't be applied in geometry. It can! What I was saying though, to my friend, is that it's not completely obvious that the formula for the area of a rectangle is breadth x height when the dimensions are no longer integers. For integer dimensions, it is completely obvious but for irrational dimensions (which tend to be naughty sometimes), can we still trust our intuition? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489373"> I've clarified it in my main post. Hopefully that should provide people with a better picture of a 'nail on the head' answer. The closest so far would be joe johnson's answer, which unfortunately remains hidden far at the bottom of all the answers. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489393"> @Trogdor The fact that you think Joe Johnson's answer is closest to what you want simply illustrates how unclear your question is. I think many people would argue that his answer is not best, but you are the OP. I'd try to tighten it up a bit. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489422"> @Trogdor idont know what r u tryin to prove but .... an a*b rectangle of irrational dimentions , if you straighten the perimeter of a <span class="math-container" id="11416640" visual_id="6591163"><math alttext="radius=1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> circle as a whole segment , than put the trigonometric tangent of an insider angle <span class="math-container" id="11416641" visual_id="8676407"><math alttext="tan(\theta=\pi/3)=\sqrt{3}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>π</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mn>3</mn></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span> as a second dimention of 90° angle with the first segment , you have difinitely an irrational surface value of <span class="math-container" id="11416642" visual_id="2079741"><math alttext="\sqrt{3}\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>3</mn></msqrt><mo>⁢</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> ,if you convert to decimal rounded floting value=5.44 on paper, that would have bad consequences because further we keep working on with that fake value  we will have bigger error gap more we advance in calculation </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489423"> @magicman Well, I think you're at least thinking in the right direction. As I understood the story, Hipparchus was murdered for letting the secret out. Which I guess technically fits the question but is something of a special case. It wasn't a natural result of a math error, it was a human sanction. And actually a sanction for getting it right, not for getting it wrong. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2489437"> @Jay Your comment just now *further* shows how unclear the question is as it currently stands. "Has lack of mathematical rigour killed anybody before?"--directly? Indirectly? One person? Etc. There are *so* many ways to view this question, but I think it's fair to say my answer is a little unique in that there's a twist compared to how most other answers have been provided so far. Like you said, and as I point out in my answer, it was really the Pythagoreans who dropped the ball. Basic point: question needs to be made airtight; otherwise, non-legitimate answers will continue to be submitted. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2517784"> I think this qualifies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Captain_%281869%29 </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2690915"> Ah, a so-called rigour mortis. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3108421"> Look up the [Sleipner A Oil Platform](http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold//disasters/sleipner.html) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5402577"> This reminded be of an anecdote my professor told me (not sure if true). The story goes that while reusing old components for building a new spaceship, the enigneers tested an O-ring (or was it a pipe, no idea) for having the correct shape (circular) by measuring its thickness for all orientations. Since they measured a constant width, they concluded it must be circular. Their mistake: there are many more [curves of constant width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_of_constant_width). This misclassification caused welded joints to tear apart during the start. </td></tr>

<p>Perhaps you might think this answer won't be appropriate for the mathematics Stack Exchange site, but rather for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/tour">Programmers</a>. But really, the deaths in this instance <em>may have been influenced by</em> a lack of rigour in programming of a mathematical system, so I thought it might apply.</p> <p>In 1991, 28 soldiers were killed by an Iraqi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scud missile</a> at an army barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Patriot missile</a> system was programmed incorrectly resulting in a floating point error on the internal clock of the system resulting in a time error of approximately 0.34 seconds at the time of the incident.</p> <p>Combined with the Scud velocity of ~1676 m/s, the Patriot missile system radar incorrectly placed the missile over half a kilometer from its true position, which was incidentally outside of its "range gate".  From what I have gathered, the Patriot system essentially looked in the wrong place of the sky because of this and failed to shoot the missile down.</p> <p>It may not necessarily be 100% true that this error <em>caused</em> the deaths. Who knows if the Patriot missile would have hit the Scud even if it weren't for the error. Thus, this may not really answer your question perfectly, but it certainly highlights the importance of rigour when applying math to real systems.</p> <p><strong>Additional</strong></p> <p>From the GAO report:</p> <p><em>On February 11, 199 1, the Patriot Project Office received Israeli data identifying a 20 percent shift in the Patriot system’s radar range gate after the system had been running for 8 consecutive hours. (Figure 4 depicts the location of a Scud within the range gate after the Patriot has been in operation for over 8 hours.) This shift is significant because it meant that the target (in this case, the Scud) was no longer in the center of the range gate. The target needs to be in the center of the range gate to ensure the highest probability of tracking the target. As previously mentioned, the range gate is calculated by an algorithm that determines if the detected target is a Scud, and if the Scud is in the Patriot’s firing range. If these conditions are met, the Patriot fires its missiles.......Patriot Project Office officials said that the Patriot system will not track a Scud when there is a range gate shift of 50 percent or more. Because the shift is directly proportional to time, extrapolating the Israeli data (which indicated a 20 percent shift after 8 hours) determined that the range gate would shift 50 percent after about 20 hours of continuous use. Specifically, after about 20 hours, the inaccurate time calculation becomes sufficiently large to cause the radar to look in the wrong place for the target. Consequently, the system fails to track and intercept the Scud</em></p> <p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jgOaT.png"/></p> <p>Sources:</p> <p><a href="http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/455.f96/disasters.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/455.f96/disasters.html</a></p> <p><a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/users/vuik/wi211/disasters.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/users/vuik/wi211/disasters.html</a></p> <p><strong>Full GAO Report</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/220/215614.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gao.gov/assets/220/215614.pdf</a></p>

<tr><td comment_id="2488457"> That's not my understanding of the failure.  Rather, the computer tried to plot an intercept course against the missile and it was plotting the inbound and the Patriot at different times, causing the tracks to not converge.  I do not think this case should be counted, though, as the Patriot had an abysmal record against Scuds--had it fired it almost certainly would have failed anyway. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488576"> I am not entirely sure, as I have only read the small excerpts I have found.  But your comment prompted me to search a bit more and I have linked the full GAO report in my answer. One of the opening pages, under "Results in Brief", states...*At the time of the incident, the battery had been operating continuously for over 100 hours. By then, the inaccuracy was serious enough to cause the system to look in the wrong placefor the incoming Scud.*  I am not really sure if there is a difference between what you are saying and what I'm saying. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488581"> In other words, perhaps "looking in the wrong place of the sky" really means plotting an intercept course at the wrong place of the sky. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2488592"> Oh you are highlighting the patriot battery plotting the courses at different times as opposed to thinking the missile was elsewhere.  Everything I have read/seen seems to indicate that the battery thought the missile was in the wrong place.  See the quote/picture I have added to my answer. </td></tr>
