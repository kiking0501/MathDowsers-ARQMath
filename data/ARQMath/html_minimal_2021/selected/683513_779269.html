<h1> Evaluating the reception of (epsilon, delta) definitions </h1>

<p>There is much discussion both in the education community and the mathematics community concerning the challenge of (epsilon, delta) type definitions in real analysis and the student reception of it. My impression has been that the mathematical community often holds an upbeat opinion on the success of student reception of this, whereas the education community often stresses difficulties and their "baffling" and "inhibitive" effect (see below). A typical educational perspective on this was recently expressed by Paul Dawkins in the following terms: </p> <p><em>2.3. Student difficulties with real analysis definitions. The concepts of limit and continuity have posed well-documented difficulties for students both at the calculus and analysis level of instructions (e.g. Cornu, 1991; Cottrill et al., 1996; Ferrini-Mundy &amp; Graham, 1994; Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981; Williams, 1991). Researchers identified difficulties stemming from a number of issues: the language of limits (Cornu, 1991; Williams, 1991), multiple quantification in the formal definition (Dubinsky, Elderman, &amp; Gong, 1988; Dubinsky &amp; Yiparaki, 2000; Swinyard &amp; Lockwood, 2007), implicit dependencies among quantities in the definition (Roh &amp; Lee, 2011a, 2011b), and persistent notions pertaining to the existence of infinitesimal quantities (Ely, 2010). Limits and continuity are often couched as formalizations of approaching and connectedness respectively. However, the standard, formal definitions display much more subtlety and complexity. That complexity often baffles students who cannot perceive the necessity for so many moving parts. Thus learning the concepts and formal definitions in real analysis are fraught both with need to acquire proficiency with conceptual tools such as quantification and to help students perceive conceptual necessity for these tools. This means students often cannot coordinate their concept image with the concept definition, inhibiting their acculturation to advanced mathematical practice, which emphasizes concept definitions.</em> </p> <p>See <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2013.10.002" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2013.10.002</a> for the entire article (note that the online article provides links to the papers cited above).</p> <p>To summarize, in the field of education, researchers decidedly have <em>not</em> come to the conclusion that epsilon, delta definitions are either "simple", "clear", or "common sense". Meanwhile, mathematicians often express contrary sentiments. Two examples are given below. </p> <p><em>...one cannot teach the concept of limit without using the epsilon-delta definition. Teaching such ideas intuitively does not make it easier for the student it makes it harder to understand. Bertrand Russell has called the rigorous definition of limit and convergence the greatest achievement of the human intellect in 2000 years! The Greeks were puzzled by paradoxes involving motion; now they all become clear, because we have complete understanding of limits and convergence. Without the proper definition, things are difficult. With the definition, they are simple and clear.</em> (see Kleinfeld, Margaret; Calculus: Reformed or Deformed? Amer. Math. Monthly 103 (1996), no. 3, 230-232.) </p> <p><em>I always tell my calculus students that mathematics is not esoteric: It is common sense. (Even the notorious epsilon, delta definition of limit is common sense, and moreover is central to the important practical problems of approximation and estimation.)</em> (see Bishop, Errett; Book Review: Elementary calculus. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 83 (1977), no. 2, 205--208.)</p> <p>When one compares the upbeat assessment common in the mathematics community and the somber assessments common in the education community, sometimes one wonders whether they are talking about the same thing. How does one bridge the gap between the two assessments? Are they perhaps dealing with distinct student populations? Are there perhaps education studies providing more upbeat assessments than Dawkins' article would suggest? </p> <p>Note 1. See also <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/158145/assessing-effectiveness-of-epsilon-delta-definitions">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/158145/assessing-effectiveness-of-epsilon-delta-definitions</a></p> <p>Note 2. Two approaches have been proposed to account for this difference of perception between the education community and the math community: (a) sample bias: mathematicians tend to base their appraisal of the effectiveness of these definitions in terms of the most active students in their classes, which are often the best students; (b) student/professor gap: mathematicians base their appraisal on their own scientific appreciation of these definitions as the "right" ones, arrived at after a considerable investment of time and removed from the original experience of actually learning those definitions.  Both of these sound plausible, but it would be instructive to have field research in support of these approaches.</p> <p>We recently published <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5642/jhummath.201701.07" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an article</a> reporting the result of student polling concerning the comparative educational merits of epsilon-delta definitions and infinitesimal definitions of key concepts like continuity and convergence, with students favoring the infinitesimal definitions by large margins.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="1594282"> I think there is a wide misconception that mathematics is something you understand in a first read. It might very well happen, but it is usually not the case. Modern definitions are the result of many years of investigation and thinking of people, and this "good" definitions might sometimes be hard to grasp or nonintuitive. A definition is like a jawbraker, you cannot take it in one bite, rather, you have to keep it in your mouth and wait to get to the center. [Like so](http://i.imgur.com/2oD4kAQ.gif). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1594303"> Hi @Pedro, I appreciate your insight. I recall liking the challenge of reading Lang's algebra book when I was an undergraduate. One of my peers pointed out that van der waerden's Algebra was more accessible. When I pointed out that Lang makes you *think*, he retorted that van der Waerden makes you *understand*. With time I came to appreciate his viewpoint. I think there are two genuinely different approaches to learning at work here, and each may be more appropriate than the other depending on the particular circumstances of the course in question. Incidentally your image was blocked by K9. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1594312"> Oh, it is merely a cartoon. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1614498"> The thing I hated the most in textbooks was when they introduced concepts with absolutely zero motivation or explanation. I find that one needs to look very hard to find books that are actually designed to teach you something, rather than just a collection of 'theorem/proof' blocks meant for people who are already familiar with the material. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1614931"> @PedroTamaroff I must respectfully disagree.  A definition must be no less understandable than the concept it is trying to describe.  That is the way of true logic, from the generally accepted and understood idea towards the harder to understand and accept.  Most difficult definitions should actually be theorems, but authors don't want to be bothered to include the reasoning behind a definition.  Too often definitions are used as a crutch to avoid difficult but logically necessary mathematics. </td></tr>

<p>First let me focus on the reasons behind the difficulty in assimilating the <span class="math-container" id="6865602" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definitions.</p> <p>For any beginner in calculus, assimilating the <span class="math-container" id="6865603" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definition is a challenge. I have rarely seen any student for whom this definition seems natural. I don't think anyone would dispute that given the fact that these definitions were arrived at after a long long time Newton invented calculus.</p> <p>However the reasons for the difficulty in assimilating these definitions is not so much related to the definitions, but rather to the approach of presenting them to students. A student who is learning calculus for the first time normally has experience of algebraical manipulation but has very less interaction with order relations or inequalities. And another block is the understanding of "infinite". A student needs to be trained first in order relations and some understanding of "infinite". I can illustrate my point with two examples:</p> <p>1) A student of 13 yrs of age would find it very easy to solve <span class="math-container" id="6865604" visual_id="5608901"><math alttext="x+5=3" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> and at the same time find it bit difficult to solve <span class="math-container" id="6865605" visual_id="5608902"><math alttext="|x-5|&amp;lt;3" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>.</p> <p>2) A student of 16 yrs of age would find it easy to show that there is no rational number whose square is <span class="math-container" id="6865606" visual_id="358"><math alttext="2" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>2</mn></semantics></math></span>. But at the same time he will be hard pressed to show that we can find <strong>as good</strong> rational approximation to <span class="math-container" id="6865607" visual_id="700"><math alttext="\sqrt{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></semantics></math></span> <strong>as we want</strong> especially if you don't allow him the square root extraction method to find decimal approximation of <span class="math-container" id="6865608" visual_id="700"><math alttext="\sqrt{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></semantics></math></span> to any number of digits.</p> <p>I would say that there is a huge gap between "algebraical manipulation of expressions" and "appreciation of inequalities and infinite nature of integers and rationals" in terms of problem solving techniques and related conceptual framework. Unless this gap is bridged by the student himself or through his teachers, it is natural to expect that the student would find it challenging to accept the <span class="math-container" id="6865609" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definitions.</p> <p>Next I come to question asked here. Mathematics community in general feels that these definitions of calculus are the most appropriate and natural and are hugely successful in teaching huge amount of further "mathematical analysis". This is simply because once you have understood these definitions you can't think of any more natural choice of any other definition. After the initial fight with <span class="math-container" id="6865610" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is over, the general feeling is that these definitions are the simplest and most powerful tools to teach these topics. My own view is the same but I can't forget my days when I was fighting with <span class="math-container" id="6865611" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> and crossed the chasm with help of <a href="http://paramanand.blogspot.com/2005/11/book-review-course-of-pure-mathematics.html" rel="nofollow">Hardy's Pure Mathematics</a>.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="1619710"> Your basic contentions seems to be that *once you have understood these definitions you can't think of any more natural choice of any other definition. After the initial fight with <span class="math-container" id="6865612" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is over, the general feeling is that these definitions are the simplest and most powerful tools to teach these topics.* In other words, what you are arguing is that mathematicians are making a psychological error here which has to do with the student/professor gap. This is an interesting hypothesis, but has this been studied in the literature? How would one go about testing this hypothesis? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1619971"> I am not sure about any s<span class="math-container" id="14979541">p</span>ecific studies based on this hypothesis. I believe the only way to check this hypothesis is to ask a sample of students who are doing some real-analysis courses in their post-grad studies. We should ask them to compare their views on epsilon-delta when they first met this concept and their current views on this. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1623844"> This suggestion, perhaps, fits very well with the perspective suggested in the article *On The Dual Nature of Mathematical Conceptions* by Anna Sfard, published in *Educational Studies in Mathematics 22, 1-36, 1991*. She argues that the **process** of doing algorithmic operations leads through stages of gradually maturing perceptions, ultimately identifying new **objects**. Maybe freshman regards <span class="math-container" id="6865613" visual_id="21047"><math alttext="\varepsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ε</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> as heavy algorithmic **processes**, whereas the matured view is to see it as a **whole concept**, an **object**? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1623851"> In her article, A. Sfard is also referring to *Miller, G. A.: 1956, 'The magic number seven plus minus two...'* suggesting that one can only juggle about seven chunks of information in the "working memory" at the time. So for the trained <span class="math-container" id="6865615" visual_id="173042"><math alttext="\varepsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ε</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>-scholar the **concept of <span class="math-container" id="6865615" visual_id="173042"><math alttext="\varepsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ε</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>** is just one **object**, one chunk of information, whereas for the untrained person each symbol, each quantifier, occupies space in the "working memory" thus rendering the understanding nearly impossible at that stage? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1624358"> @String, thanks for these interesting comments. I suggest you format them as an "answer". Otherwise nobody notices them (I didn't even get notification of a comment even though I am the question poser). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1624372"> @user72694: OK, I will! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1624378"> @String, by the way this educational approach is also known as "proceptual" (in Tall's terminology) and "encapsulation" (this I think is Dubinsky and perhaps also others). So then your answer to my question seems to be that mathematicians are insufficiently aware of the work of Sfard, Tall, and Dubinsky :-) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1624510"> @user72694: That could very well be. On the other hand, the **reification** (making into an *object*) of a mathematical **process**, may not be so random after all. Perhaps some representations of mathematical concepts works better than others in order to, eventually, build an intuitive **object** in the practitioners mind. Leibniz (the inventor of the <span class="math-container" id="6865616" visual_id="12245"><math alttext="dx" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>-symbol) was very concerned with choosing the right notation in order support both **process** and **concept**. Perhaps a nearly optimal approach exists after all. That is a tough question! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1628629"> @String: Really glad to such an extended discussion based on my answer. I believe you have put the essence of my answer in a much better way and added references to works of Miller and Anna. Thanks a lot. </td></tr>
