<p>I have just started reading Linear Algebra and there are some basic things I cannot understand. I read some answers on this site and also tried to search in some books but I didn't find a clear answer. Here are few words form my textbook : 1. Here by VECTOR we do not mean the vector quantity which we have defined in vector algebra as a directed line segment. 2. Matrices having a single row or column are referred to as vectors. 3. I also watched a <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/vectors/v/vector-introduction-linear-algebra">video</a> in which at approximately 3:55 he says that a point in two dimensional real coordinate space is written in matrix form in LINEAR ALGEBRA.</p> <p><strong>Now I'm confused! Since in the video it seems as a vector in LINEAR ALGEBRA is just same as a point in 1, 2, 3...n real coordinate spaces. But in my text book its written that vector is not the vector quantity!</strong></p> <ol start="3"> <li>And I also read in a book in which it was written that we are using LINEAR word instead of VECTOR to avoid confusion! </li> </ol> <p><strong>So is it really the difference in words? Why its not written clearly what the vector really is.</strong></p>

<tr><td comment_id="3234823"> A vector is an element of a vector space.  A space is a set with some property attaced. The term "vector" is letting you know which properties are attached. They include, amongst other things, multiplication by a scalar. Many things can be seen as vectors including functions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3234832"> No @janmarqz I do not think its clear enough for ME to understand! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3234848"> The word "vector" means different things in different contexts.

Sometimes "vector" means an equivalence class of directed line segments. Sometimes "vector" simply means "an element of a vector space" that we are working with.
