<p>At school, I really struggled to understand the concept of imaginary numbers.  My teacher told us that an imaginary number is a number that has something to do with the square root of <span class="math-container" id="2298522" visual_id="343"><math alttext="-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>.

To this day I still do not understand imaginary numbers.  It makes no sense to me at all.  Is there someone here who totally gets it and can explain it?</p> <p>Why is the concept even useful?</p>

Mind you, you'll still get real numbers when you do the mathematics that would result in most things that you'd expect a real number for (distance between two numbers on the complex plane is still a real number, as are the magnitudes of imaginary vectors). In a related manner, there are alternate formulations of quantum mechanics which involve negative probabilities instead, but I understand it makes the math more complex.

I would have said, for example, that while Santa Claus does not exist, the *idea* of Santa Claus certainly does exist.

This is exactly what I am disagreeing. The complex numbers were "discovered" in 16th century, long before they were used in the Schrödinger equation. Nobody dreamdt of quantum physics at that time. If they are just an idea like a story, how come they are used essentially in the equation which describes the fundamental law of the universe? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461010"> @MakotoKato: To answer this question, let me ask another question: All theories are written in some language, be it Latin, English, German or whatever. Using a language turns out to be essential for writing theories; you couldn't do it without. Should I conclude that languages are not a construct of the human mind, but somehow part of the intrinsic structure of the universe? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461019"> @celtschk Mathematics is not a language. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461029"> @MakotoKato: I didn't say it is. I applied your *argument* to language, to demonstrate that it doesn't work. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461063"> @celtschk Mathematics is not a language. So I don't see why your argument demonstrates that my argument does not work. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="461131"> @MakotoKato: Your argument was using the rule: "X turns out to be very useful, if not essential, for theories of physics, therefore X is somehow part of the universe." You applied that argument for "X=mathematics". I applied it for "X=language" and got an obviously wrong result, thus invalidating the rule. Since the rule is invalid, its application to mathematics is also invalid. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="462610"> @celtschk It's not just useful. It's indispensable. If you don't know much about quantum physics, I guess it's hard for you to understand this, though. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466012"> @MakotoKato: I'm a physicist working in quantum information, so I know quantum mechanics *quite* well. However, I'm also able to distinguish between the model of reality (Quantum mechanics) and reality itself. The success of quantum mechanics shows that there's something in nature which can be quite well mapped onto mathematical structures using complex numbers. That does *not* imply that there are complex numbers in nature (just as the fact that for centuries we've successfully mapped real objects onto locations and momenta which are exactly defined at the same time doesn't imply that … </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466013"> there are in nature any objects which indeed do have well-defined locations and momenta; indeed, according to quantum mechanics, they don't, and modern experiments agree with the quantum mechanica predictions). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466237"> @celtschk If the complex numbers(which were *discoverd* in 16th century) are just an idea like a story which one makes up freely, why is it used *essentially* to describe the fundamental law of the universe? Do you think it is an accident? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466260"> @celtschk Maybe the following link is of some use for you to understand what I'm talking about.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466263"> First: We *don't know* whether it is the fundamental law of the universe. It's the best we currently have. But then, classical mechanics was considered the fundamental laws for centuries, and today we know it isn't. Second: We use complex numbers for it because it turns out that they are *useful* in formulating the concepts which we use to model the universe. Note that we do *not* model the universe with complex numbers. We model the universe with operators and rays in Hilbert spaces. Now those Hilbert spaces are described with complex numbers. I don't know if the very same Hilbert spaces … </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466268"> could be described without complex numbers. However I know for sure that Hilbert spaces are not the only way to describe quantum mechanics (although I don't know enough about those alternative descriptions which have been developed to say whether they use complex numbers; but then, there are almost certainly others which we haven't yet found, and I see no reason to assume that all of them use complex numbers). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="466306"> @celtschk Even if it is not the fundamental law of the universe, the fact that the Schrödinger equation describes and predicts pyhsical phenomena *very* accurately remains. I repeat my question. Do you think it(that the complex numbers are used essentially in the equation) is an accident? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="470922"> @MakotoKato: It might for example be an artefact of the fact that Lie groups are most easily worked with in their <span class="math-container" id="2298531" visual_id="5149872"><math alttext="GL(d,\mathbb{C})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>ℂ</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> representation. Also, if you look at the space of density matrices, they form a convex set in a *real* vector space (that's despite the density matrices are denoted by complex matrices). Unitary transformations translate into orthogonal transformations which keep that set invariant. And Hermitian operators are associated with linear function in that space. Who says that this real vector space is not more fundamental than the complex space of Hilbert space vectors? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471506"> @MakotoKato: Just another argument which just came to me: You know that the Schrödinger equation has complex solutions. However if you look at the gauge transformations of the electromagnetic field and how they affect the wave function, you'll notice that you can completely gauge away the complex phases, and then get a real wave function and a corresponding electromagnetic potential and vector potential (if there were already such potentials to begin with, they are modified accordingly). That way, you get a completely real (but more complicated) form of quantum mechanics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471554"> @celtschk Are you trying to say that complex numbers are not indispensable in physics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="471570"> @MakotoKato: I can't tell for sure (for that, I'd have to know *much* more), but I definitely wouldn't exclude the possibility. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="472229"> @celtschk Do you agree with that complex numbers are indispensable in the Schrödinger equation? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="472940"> @MakotoKato: That depends very much on what you mean with "the Schrödinger equation". If you mean the equation exactly as normally formulated, then yes, because there's an explicit i in it. But that doesn't tell us much because nature doesn't care about which of many equivalent ways to formulate a theory we use. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="473861"> @celtschk Another example: Complex analytic manifolds called Calabi–Yau manifolds play an important role in physics. Do you still think that it is an accident that complex numbers are used in physics? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="778691"> Incidentally, "imaginary" numbers have physical existence (w/o even using quantum theory). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1463401"> You only believe negative numbers "exist" because the idea has been presented to you since you were a small child and because you can see how naturally they fit in, i.e. even very simple math involving ones checking account might become "awkward" without them. But face it, you've never had negative one oranges in your hand or negative one of any physical object.  Imaginary numbers are only imaginary in that they are so-named and in that they require more complicated math to recognize how terribly awkward it is to close one's eyes and pretend they don't exist.

<div answer_id="200015" id="answer">
<p>This question has already been answered quite thoroughly, but I just want to add that generally speaking, besides the whole numbers, none of the numbers we use "exist" in the real world.  The only reason we have adopted extensions to the whole numbers to the natural, integer, rational, real, and complex sets in turn is because these extensions make problems solvable when thinking <em>abstractly</em>.  At the end of the day, everything relates back to the whole numbers, however.</p> <p>Most people use all of the sets except for complex numbers in very commonplace, everyday situations, which is why we've come to view everything up to the real numbers as being fairly intuitive, at least at first glance. (When you dig under the surface, everything gets a great deal more subtle, which is why there are people who study primarily numbers, who we call number theorists.  But that's a whole other story.)</p> <p>It's important to note that this progression isn't the only way to extend the whole numbers.  There are hundreds of different arithmetics that have been designed, many not even based on the whole numbers.  It's just that the usual extension applies to so many situations that come up commonly.  (People who study universal algebra study the ways in which different possible math systems are alike and different.  But that's a whole other story as well.)</p> <p>Complex numbers have taken their place as the normal extension to the reals because they are so useful when dealing with polynomials, which happen to arise in a massive number of mathematical situations.  They also allow the exponential function and the trigonometric functions to be viewed as special cases of the same thing, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula">Euler's Formula</a>, which enables all sorts of great algebra tricks.  Specifically, these sorts of functions pop up constantly when using either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier</a> series to simplify the process of working on problems with tricky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function">transcendental functions</a>.  Complex numbers make dealing with these representations a breeze (relatively).</p> <p>There are even further extensions.  If instead of worrying about how to take the square root of -1, you worry about what happens past infinity, the real numbers can alternatively be expanded in several jumps to include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number">hyperreals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superreal_number">superreals</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_numbers">surreals</a>.  None of these systems have caught on, though, because we have alternative ways of dealing with the infinite and infinitesimal quantities in calculus that people find more powerful/convenient.</p> <p>You can also zip on past complex numbers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">Quaternions</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion">octonions</a> on top of that.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector">Vectors</a> generalize all of the above.  They aren't often though of as numbers, but are similar in that they generalize the concept of a property of an object having a mathematical value.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29">Matrixes</a> generalize vectors, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensors">tensors</a> generalize matrixes.  </p> <p>As you climb this ladder, you gain more and more mathematical power, but you start to lose properties that we expect of whole numbers.  For complex numbers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">order</a> (greater than/less than) begins to become ambiguous.  We generally don't think of vectors as "numbers" because we want all operations on vectors to work regardless of dimension, and most of the arithmetic operations don't really generalize.  With matrixes, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative">commutative property</a> goes out the window, and things start to get really weird, especially when the matrixes aren't square.  And so forth.</p> <p>All of this to say that numbers are best viewed as machinery.  Different number systems are really only used to the extent which they make a given math situation or problem easier to think about.  If you're an engineer, complex numbers do this in many, many situations, which justifies their added...complexity.  If you're not an engineer, they're definitely worth understanding, but you may not find uses for them on a daily basis.  </p>

There are only ever more abstract abstractions. Pure mathematicians study these things for their own sakes, looking for deeper truths, while applied mathematicians develop the math around use cases.

You might choose a more familiar tool, even if its not the optimal fit. This is one reason why matrices are so popular. </td></tr>
