Here, it is requested to find the limit of an infinite series (not an integral). Incidentally, it equals to the Riemann sum of  a particular definite integral. Then, FTC is used to calculate that definite integral. Obviously, the value of that definite integral would be defined by the original infinite series to be found. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5047707"> Just to be precise the kind of limit you are talking in that link is not an infinite series but rather a limit of the form <span class="math-container" id="22618289" visual_id="4758726"><math alttext="\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}f(n,k)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mo>lim</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∑</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></msubsup><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>.

The infinite series is not incidentally related to an integral, but rather this relation between the integral and the series is an immediate consequence of the definition of integral. And integrals are generally evaluated using FTC rather than using the definition of integral. Don't understand why one would accuse here. </td></tr>
