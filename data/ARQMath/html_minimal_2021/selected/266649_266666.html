<p>Will the terms complex and imaginary ever be replaced? At least within beginning classes?</p> <p>I imagine it is more of a kind of hazing into the "mathemitician's club" to allow the terms to confuse students (the implication is that if terminology is too much of a problem for a student, then the student is just not "good" at math.) But would it not be better to use such terms as "irregular numbers" instead of "imaginary numbers", and "complete field" instead of "complex field"? The original terms are only convention after all (albeit a very established one.)</p> <p>I remember when first learning about <span class="math-container" id="2950439" visual_id="27695"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></semantics></math></span> and musing about what it really is. Now that I am more experienced I know it is just a concept within a consistent system of rules. Why label it as complex along with the connotations of the term, or as imaginary insinuating the non-existence of it. Of course it exists--even if only as a concept or a "completion". It exists just as much as any "real" number exists. It just has a different place in the field, the field that includes <span class="math-container" id="2950440" visual_id="27695"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></semantics></math></span>.</p> <p>My suggested replacements may step on other established terms that I do not use regularly. Does anyone have any other suggestions? At least for the beginning students?</p> <p>Maybe the question can be answered by voting. My suggestion can still use <span class="math-container" id="2950441" visual_id="1492"><math alttext="\mathbb{C}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℂ</mi></semantics></math></span> for the field, and <span class="math-container" id="2950442" visual_id="51075"><math alttext="i=\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span>, which are some of the reasons I like it. Can we have other suggestions?</p> <p>(I originally thought this would be a community wiki, where is that option?)</p>
