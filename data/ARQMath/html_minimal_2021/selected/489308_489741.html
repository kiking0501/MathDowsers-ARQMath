<p>I read the Blue Eyes puzzle <a href="http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, and the <a href="http://xkcd.com/solution.html" rel="noreferrer">solution</a> which I find quite interesting.

Then how is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if each person can dismiss these 2 cases immediately as possibilities?  </p></li> <li><p>Why must they wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know?</p></li> </ol> <p>EDIT: Most answers seem to concentrate on question 1 which I understand partly: but I remain confused because of different answers.

<tr><td comment_id="1052999"> It's a good puzzle, but certainly does not qualify as the hardest logic puzzle in the world. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053031"> A useful reference is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053035"> I've read the verions with the monks and the gnomes before. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053421"> Previously: [Is there no solution to the “hardest” puzzle?](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/238288/856) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053602"> @IttayWeiss: it’s not hardest in the sense of lengthy computation, and it’s certainly not the hardest if you include puzzles requiring specialist knowledge; but it’s surely a contender for “the conceptually hardest puzzle accessible to non-mathematicians”. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053885"> Maybe after 99 answers, someone will post a correct and comprehensible solution. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054562"> @IttayWeiss, what is an example of a harder logic problem? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054924"> @chris the main reason I consider this puzzle to be on the easy side is that once you reduce it to 2 and then 3 people, the analysis is immediate and gives the solution. Puzzles that don't allow for such reductions tend to be more difficult. For instance, the island with infinitely many logicians (who believe in the axiom of choice and possess amazing eye-sight and incredible memory, the witch who intends to place either a black or white hat on each logician's head, then ask them to at once state a color. If only finitely many of them get their own color wrong, the all live. Make them live. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1055578"> @Ittay: Make them all stand in line, with as rule that there neighbours must both have the same coloured hat. They will now ling up with black and white hats alternately. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1055619"> @dorus I don't follow you. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1055656"> I'm not sure if your rules would allow this. But let's say you let them all hold hands, and they can only hold the hands of 2 others with the same coloured hat. They can now form circles (or one VERY long line), where every logician know his hat has the same colour as his neighbour's neighbour. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1056080"> The point of Ittay's puzzle is that they have to agree on a strategy *in advance*, applicable to any assignment of hat colors and without further communication. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1057397"> @aufkag: Your question 2 shows how hard it is to formulate such puzzles clearly. The description makes it clear to me that the islanders do *not* know in advance how many of them have blue eyes; but it doesn't to you, apparently. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1057408"> @reinierpost It's not my question. My username is there because I slightly edited the question. That's all. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1058596"> @aufkag: ouch. sorry </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1081933"> I think I can answer question 2, but question 3 is really bugging me - why isn't some equivalent of Randal's Theorem 98 common knowledge? I know that everyone else can see the eye colours of everyone around them, and I know that there are 99 other people with blue eyes, each of whom sees either 98 or 99 blue-eyed people themselves. So why don't we accept that everyone has sufficient evidence to establish an effective Theorem 98 off the bat? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1085963"> Actually, I think I get it now - everybody knows that there are at least 98 people with blue eyes, but not everybody knows that everybody knows that, and it takes 98 days after the Guru's utterance to establish that.  Everybody *does* know that everybody knows that there are at least *97* people with blue eyes, but it also takes 98 days to establish that everybody knows *that*. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2021910"> The whole puzzle is flawed nonsense. Suppose there were exactly two blue eyes: they each see one, everyone else sees two. On the first night the failure of either to leave lets them deduce they must also have blue eyes so they both leave the second night, and by induction N leave on the Nth night. No oracle is required. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2568039"> @TheMathemagician those two with blue eyes would depart on the second day, since they only say one people with blue eyes. The others say two, so "would have departed" on day three, but they didn't since the other two already departed on day two. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3698892"> @TheMathemagician I don't see how anyone not leaving lets anyone deduce anything except that the people involved don't know the color of their own eyes, if they stayed.  Just because someone stays doesn't tell them anything about their own eye color, given the knowledge there is at least one person with blue eyes - it only says that the person that had blue eyes couldn't figure out they had blue eyes and could leave. Given this example, a brown-eyed person could equally think they have blue eyes, when they learn there is at least one among them that has blue eyes. It doesn't make them right. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3807500"> All the answers so far have ignored the implications of (1) the fact that any given person knows that there cannot be fewer blue-eyed people than the number that he can see, and (2) the common knowledge that everyone knows that there cannot be fewer than the number they can see less 1.  Please see my answer to a similar question on Puzzling.SE here: http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/37673/20907 </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4667630"> https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/q/236/9366 </td></tr>

<blockquote> <p>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have?</p> </blockquote> <p>The Guru provides the <em>common knowledge</em> that there is somebody with blue eyes. Basically, every person knows that <span class="math-container" id="5138377" visual_id="7300"><math alttext="\exists" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>∃</mo></semantics></math></span> somebody with blue eyes, and every person knows that every person knows that, and so on ad infinitum.</p> <blockquote> <p>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities?</p> </blockquote> <p>Because for this person (person A), there are two possibilities:</p> <ul> <li>He is blue eyed (100:100)</li> <li>He is brown eyed (99:101)</li> </ul> <p>So A can't leave immediately.</p> <p>For the second one, let's pick a person B in person A's visualization. B sees only 98. In B's mind (remember, B is a figment of A's imagination while visualizing option 2), there are two possibilities:</p> <ul> <li>He is blue eyed (99:101)</li> <li>He is brown eyed (98:102)</li> </ul> <p>So, A knows that B can't leave immediately.</p> <p>Now, in B's mind <em>in A's mind</em>, there are two possibilities for a person C to leave:</p> <ul> <li>He is blue eyed (98:102)</li> <li>He is brown eyed (97:103)</li> </ul> <p>Again, two possibilities, A knows that B knows that C can't leave.</p> <p>This keeps going, till we reach person Y in an Inception-esque layered imagination of the rest, who has two options:</p> <ul> <li>He is blue eyed (2:198)</li> <li>He is brown eyed (1:199)</li> </ul> <p>If it is the latter, he can see a person Z and imagine his options:</p> <ul> <li>He is blue eyed (1:199)</li> <li><s>He is brown eyed (0:200)</s> This is not possible, as there has to be at least one blue eyed person.</li> </ul> <p>Z has only one option, then. But we can't just pick this because this option only comes into play if Y knew that he was brown eyed, which only comes into play if X knew he was brown eyed, and so on all the way back up to B. </p> <p>So, on the first day, because Z doesn't leave, the idea of there only being one blue eyed person is ruled out.</p> <p>Wasn't it ruled out from the beginning? Yes, however it could not be ruled out from the minds of the others while visualizing.</p> <p>Remember, A knows that if he had brown eyes (9:101), then B <em>would be considering the option that he has brown eyes too (98:101)</em>, even if that doesn't add up from A's perspective. We have to take into account what options are being considered.</p> <blockquote> <p>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know?</p> </blockquote> <p>They don't know it. Each blue person knows that it's either 99:100 or 100:100, but can't pick. They need to wait to ensure that it works.</p> <hr/> <h2>A simpler problem</h2> <p>Let me try to work out the second part again for 6 islanders, where the actual distribution is (3:3). The bullets are chronologically ordered, the nesting is Inception-esque imagination.</p> <ul> <li>Blue eyed person A knows that there are at least 2 blue eyed people. He knows that if he is blue eyed, the other blue eyes are thinking the same as him. But this isn't the only possible case. The lack of any definite knowledge means that they don't leave (yet). If he considers the case that he has brown eyes, he visualizes that: <ul> <li>Blue eyed person B knows that there is at least 1 blue eyed person. If there were 2, then both would be thinking the same thing, and again, due to lack of definite knowledge, they can't leave. It there is one, he visualizes that: <ul> <li>Blue eyed person C sees 0 blue eyed people. Concludes that he must be The One. Leaves.</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li>On the first day, no one leaves. On the second day, <ul> <li>Blue eyed person A knows that there are at least 2 blue eyed people. He knows that if he is blue eyed, the other blue eyes are thinking the same as him. The lack of any definite knowledge means that they don't leave (yet). However, if he considers that he has brown eyes, he visualizes that: <ul> <li>Blue eyed person B knows that there is at least 1 blue eyed person. If there were 2, then both would be thinking the same thing. If there is one (C), then B knows that C would have left the day earlier. That didn't happen. So.. there must be two. As both are thinking the same thing, both leave.</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li>On the second day, no one leaves. On the third day, <ul> <li>Blue eyed person A knows that there are at least 2 blue eyed people. He knows that if he is blue eyed, the other blue eyes are thinking the same as him. If there are only two blue eyed people, then they would have left the day earlier. Which didn't happen. So he must have blue eyes, and as all three are thinking the same thing, they all have blue eyes. The three leave.</li> </ul></li> <li>The brown eyes leave the next day.</li> </ul> <p>Note that while initially it is clear that the number of blue eyes <span class="math-container" id="5138378" visual_id="2811626"><math alttext="&amp;gt;=2" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">&amp;</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>;</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>, the number of blue eyes can be less from the point of view of someone when another is considering the option that he is brown eyed. The lower numbers only come in due to this "but what is <em>he</em> thinking" thought that gets nested.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="1053864"> If the guru add no information, then nothing can change. Imagine that it is a written law that all blue-eyes people must leave. A law known to anybody. Without the guru's words nothing will happen and no-one will leave. So the Guru must add some information (look-up complete knowledge). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053877"> @IttayWeiss The new knowledge is that "nobody else left". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053889"> that isn't it either, since the guru did not say that. The question is: at the instance the guru speaks, what new information does at least one of the people have that (s)he did not have before. The answers can't be 'nothing' since then behavior can't change (and if the guru said nothing, then nobody ever leaves). So the answer must be something, and it must be some piece of information not knows before guru speaks, yet known immediately afterwards. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053895"> @IttayWeiss The new information is "nobody left". See the last section, it becomes clearer as the thought process is outlined carefully. Information need not be externally injected. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053949"> "nobody<span class="math-container" id="9418353"> </span>left" is not new information. Suppose the guru had said "If I told you right now that blue eyed people exist, would you expect anybody to leave by tomorrow?". The answer (with 100 blued eyed people) is 'no, we all know that that will not supply anybody with enough information to leave'. So, "nobody left" is not new information either. <span class="math-container" id="9418356">N</span>ote that there must be some new information conveyed by the *words* of the guru (not by time elapsing or anything like that), since if there is no change in the information state, then there can be no change in behavior. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053968"> @IttayWeiss Again, _see the last section of my answer_. The information isn't directly useful at that stage, however when each mind is considering the possibilities (and is considering other minds considering the possibilities), it does come into play. No, there need not be any new info conveyed by the words. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053976"> no info implies no change in behavior. If you claim otherwise, please explain how can two identical states of knowledge lead to different behavior. The guru's words certainly do convey new information to each an every person who hears them. To see that, think what would have happened if the guru instead privately delivered the message that blue eyed people exist to each of the people. In that case, nobody would ever leave and the guru's words then do not convey new information. It is the fact that the guru spoke openly that conveys new info. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1053989"> @IttayWeiss I don't claim otherwise. I refute the claim that what the guru says is the only info brought. The time axis matters. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054004"> ok, then your answer 'nothing' to the question "what is the quantified piece of information that the guru conveyed" and your apparent insistence in the comments that the words did not convey new information, are confusing (me, at least) as to what it is you claim. Of course, time passing plays a role, but the question was what do the guru's words convey (what new information). To make it clear, assume it is common-knowledge written law that all blue eyed people must leave. Without the guru's words nobody will leave. With the guru's words behavior changes. So, these words must conveye info. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054035"> @IttayWeiss Again, I refute the claim that the information must be provided by the guru. The information provided by the guru only really comes into play when there are only brow eyed people left. The information that takes 100 days to build up is provided by time. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054065"> you'll have to explain then how no new information leads to different behavior. I'm going to stop repeating myself on this matter though. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054069"> @IttayWeiss I repeat: I say that the guru is not providing _new_ info; this _does not mean_ that there is no new info coming to the minds of the others. The guru can be replaced by a placard that lists the rules and says "Initially, y'all had atleast one blue eyed member".  I assert that the knowledge that nobody reacted the day before is the new knowledge here. Again: I say that the guru is not providing info, I do not say that no new info is available. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054086"> then consider the situation where the rules are common knowledge and the only thing the guru says is "blue eyed people exist". Just that utterance either conveys new information or it does not. If it does not, then the behavior will be the same whether the utterance is made or not. If the behavior changes (which is the case!), then what new information did that utterance convey. That is the question (and the answer is: "complete knowledge" as answered already by several others posters so this discussion is really getting to be useless). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054116"> It conveys information initially, yes. Afterwards it does nothing. I agree that the guru provides information on day 1. But it conveys nothing on the next few days. Again, you are assuming that any new information _must_ be conveyed by the guru. I am not making that assumption. I ... don't think Complete Knowledge is relevant here. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054125"> complete knowledge is not just relevant here, it is precisely what's going on here. Of course the guru's words don't provide any new information after day 1. They only provide new information the instance they are spoken. New information is *also* created with every day that passes and the actions (or lack thereof) taken by the people. Again, the question was "what is the new information conveyed by the guru's words". You first claimed 'nothing' now you say the do convey information (and, correctly yet irrelevantly to the discussion, that new information is also generated by other means). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1054130"> @IttayWeiss Ah, so we do agree :p I thought we were talking about incremental knowledge on each day; that's where the confusion seemed to be coming from. I'll correct that. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1060217"> @zyx Ah, the version of the puzzle I've known is different and the guru speaks every day. I edited the answer and added a bit about common knowledge. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1060268"> You might be thinking of the Muddy Children puzzle, which is equivalent but has the children's father, in the role of 'guru', speaking every round. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1060272"> @zyx Nah, same puzzle, I just had heard of a version where the guru speaks every day (and I had not verified this with the xkcd one), with no other differences. That doesn't change anything, but I thought that this was the point the OP was confused about "every new day, does the guru provide any info?". Anyway, that got cleared up. </td></tr>
