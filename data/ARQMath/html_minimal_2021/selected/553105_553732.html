<p>I just came across this statement when I was lecturing a student on math and strictly speaking I used: </p> <blockquote> <p>Assuming that the value of <span class="math-container" id="5729406" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> equals &lt;something&gt;, ...</p> </blockquote> <p>One of my students just rose and asked me:</p> <blockquote> <p>Why do we assume so much in math? Is math really built on assumptions?</p> </blockquote> <p>I couldn't answer him, for, as far as I know, a lot of things are just assumptions. For example:</p> <ul> <li><span class="math-container" id="5729407" visual_id="363024"><math alttext="1/\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> equals zero,</li> <li><span class="math-container" id="5729408" visual_id="27695"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></semantics></math></span> is <span class="math-container" id="5729409" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span>, etc.</li> </ul> <p>So would you guys mind telling whether math is built on assumptions?</p>

I mean, we build houses on the assumption that our instruments are accurate enough and cement, bricks, etc. will remain where they are according to our calculations, and we know the sun won't explode in the next few billion years assuming our calculations and measurements are accurate enough, and we walk on our city's streets under the assumption that the probability that a huge hole will open in front of us and swallow us is as high as a standard politician's IQ, etc. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176654"> that isn't my point </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176661"> I think this is a valid question. One of my friends argued this exact same point with me, saying that math is built on assumptions (probably even a verbatim quote). My sense is that this is a generally accepted impression by outsiders. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176662"> This has been troubling me for a while now... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176663"> You make the rules of the game, much like in any other mathematical system. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176704"> I think the answer is: It is complicated. At the turn of the 20th Century people were building systems of axioms (that is, assumptions) to try and formalise what they saw in every day life. The Peano axioms formalise the natural numbers, and so on. However, Kurt Goedel proved that this approach wasn't as solid a foundation as people had hoped, so I understand that people who work in the foundations of maths have been looking elsewhere. But I don't know. I am a group theorist. Four axioms rule my life. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176924"> <span class="math-container" id="5729410" visual_id="51075"><math alttext="i=\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span> is a definition, not an assumption. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177082"> @SohamChowdhury Actually, it's *both* because it implicitly assumes that -1 has a square root (which is not true for some number systems like the Reals and the Natural numbers). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177086"> *All* thought and reasoning requires assumptions.  Period.  What's different about mathematics and formal logic is that we make them ***explicit***. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177103"> I really don't get this student's complaint, or your confusion with it. Why does "assume <span class="math-container" id="5729411" visual_id="2086"><math alttext="x=5" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>" count as something more important than assumptions in any other hypothetical story? "assume we have a child in a red cape walking to grandma's house" is doing the exact same thing.

Then one makes such a definition. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177372"> Occasionally, mathematics is built on assumptions (e.g., assuming that Fermat's Last Theorem is true…), then anchored on solid footing when the missing link is proven. However, the bulk of mathematics is not developed speculatively like that. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177374"> Axioms can be challenged (e.g., if Euclid's fifth postulate is false, you develop non-Euclidean geometries). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177637"> &gt; *Is mathematics built on assumptions?* Yes, it's all bogus.

You can look at two aspects of math. One is the real mathematics, e.i. pure mathematics which mathematicians practice simply because it is really interesting (similar to why people study literature, philosophy etc.). The other aspect is what you get out of math. You can put it to great use by applying mathematics in physics and engineering which would have gotten nowhere without math. The second aspect is certainly not wasting time. The first one depends on personal opinion. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177770"> @PratyushSarkar I think you misread my comment. I was pointing out to Robert Mastragostino that his answer to the question (or rather, his dismissal of it) does not exactly make a good case for doing mathematics.  I don't doubt that there _is_ a good case to be made; it's my field after all. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177822"> @TrevorWilson Oh lol. My bad. After rereading it a couple more times, I see what were actually saying. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177907"> You also just say "suppose the value of x is..." to avoid triggering the reaction to "assume" in cases like this. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1178005"> Everything in science *is* assumptions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1178701"> <span class="math-container" id="5729429" visual_id="363024"><math alttext="1/\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> equals zero is not an assumption; it is incorrect. <span class="math-container" id="5729429" visual_id="363024"><math alttext="1/\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> **strives to** zero is correct.

<p>Mathematics describes objects in a formal way. All objects proceed from some base assumptions which are called <em>axioms</em>. The entire logic of "doing" mathematics can be summarized as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>If</em> we have a system consisting of these axioms, <em>then</em> various interesting things emerge.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometimes it happens that the axioms resemble something in the real world: perhaps in nature, or in a man-made system like finance and whatnot, and then those interesting results give us rich models which make useful predictions: math and logic find an application.</p> <p>You cannot disagree with axioms; they have to be accepted. To disagree with an <em>axiom</em> is basically to say "I do not like this system; I want to discuss another system".  Firstly, that other system will also have its own axioms, so you cannot escape from axioms. Secondly, you cannot deny the existence of an object by denying its axioms: this is similar to the way the world does not go away when you shut your eyes and plug your ears.</p> <p>Any set of axioms that do not contradict each other "exist" in a sense. A system of axioms A, B, C exists. And so does a system of axioms not A, B, C: one in which B and C hold, but A is a falsehood. For instance see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate" rel="nofollow">Euclid's fifth postulate</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes the word <em>assume</em> is used very loosely. It is legitimate for us to invent a variable <span class="math-container" id="5729455" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> and give it a value. Whether we express this as "let us assume that <span class="math-container" id="5729456" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> is 0" or "let <span class="math-container" id="5729457" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> be 0" is just a matter of wording.</p> <p>That <span class="math-container" id="5729458" visual_id="1317009"><math alttext="\sqrt{-}1=i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msqrt><mo>-</mo></msqrt><mo>⁢</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> isn't an assumption; rather <span class="math-container" id="5729459" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> is just the name that we give to a special number which has the property that <span class="math-container" id="5729460" visual_id="117786"><math alttext="i\cdot i=-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. If we postulate it as an axiom that such a number exists, and incorporate it into algebra,  then that leads to certain results and those results are consistent and useful, giving us the complex numbers and all that follows from them.  It is the consistency which makes <span class="math-container" id="5729461" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> legitimate.</p> <p>If we postulate that <span class="math-container" id="5729462" visual_id="83403"><math alttext="\frac{1}{\infty}=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>, that will lead to inconsistencies, by means of which we can prove the same statement to be either true or false based on which steps we take. <span class="math-container" id="5729463" visual_id="83403"><math alttext="\frac{1}{\infty}=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> is bunk.</p>
