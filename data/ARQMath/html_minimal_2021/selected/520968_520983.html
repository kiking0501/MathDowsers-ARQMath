<p>This is another question like <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/520844">this one</a>.

The fact that the older daughter is a girl provides some (however small) evidence that this is one of those couples.  Which raises the probability of the younger child being a girl to something slighty more than <span class="math-container" id="5434783" visual_id="28247"><math alttext=".5" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>.5</mn></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1115541"> @littleO I see you have a point, but in these kind of exercises, I believe you can assume 0.5. </td></tr>

<p>An alternative viewpoint:</p> <p>For the eldest child to be a girl, they must have had a girl first. Therefore the probability of there being two girls is the probability of having a second girl which is <span class="math-container" id="5434794" visual_id="363"><math alttext="\frac{1}{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></semantics></math></span>.</p>
