<p>Mathematics could be defined as the study of <strong>formally defined abstractions</strong>. These abstractions may or may not be useful for describing real world phenomenon. Indeed, Physics could be defined as the <em>subset</em> of Maths that <em>does</em> describe real world phenomenon.</p> <p><strong>The integers</strong> - along with the operations of addition/multiplication - are incredibly versatile, and children can <strong>intuitively know when this abstraction is appropriate</strong>:</p> <p><img alt="3 oranges" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1vmu.png"/></p> <p>The <strong>Real Numbers</strong>, <strong>Sets</strong>, <strong>Vectors</strong> and even more complicated mathematical structures have obvious and intuitive real world correspondences.</p> <p>From my experience with talking to people about "imaginary numbers", confusion is caused more often than not by the word "imaginary" and its difficult philosophical implications. <strong>If only I could explain that they are just as "real" as all the other abstractions they use every day!</strong></p> <p>So to aid in explaining the view that complex numbers and their associated operations are simply another useful abstraction that can be applied in the same way as the more familiar types of number:</p> <p><strong>What are some easy to grasp real world situations that can be elegantly abstracted and represented by complex numbers?</strong></p> <h2>Update</h2> <p>I can see how this question is similar to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/138325/simple-applications-of-complex-numbers">this</a> but it is subtly and crucially different. This question asks for simple <strong>real world</strong> situations. That question asks for <strong>simple applications</strong> and has received a bunch of answers about how complex numbers elagently deal with other mathematical abstractions. The top answers are all referring to simple areas of mathematics where complex numbers can be applied.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="814303"> Wikipedia has a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Applications). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1421720"> Physics is not a subset of Math. Indeed, Math had a long struggle to get independent of Physics but initial ideas came from agricultural business, commerce, physics problems, etc... ( Counting, in general ). In Physics, we can think that Math is a way ( 'the way' ) to express ideas about the physical world albeit it is not always ( unfortunately ) possible. Your question is, indeed, quite interesting. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1688563"> Mathematics was physics (pythagoreans, geometry etc..). It was indeed physics expressed in symbolic form. The split into mathematics (esp.pure, not applied) and physics is a more recent one. Nevertheless, even pure math relate to (real) applications else they do not get studied or have any meaning. As i stated [elsewhere](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/811669/does-every-mathematical-construct-have-a-physical-realizable-model) "*a Group is a Grup is a Group*", and a Group is sth indeed connected and realizable in physical terms </td></tr>

<p>It is unlikely that genuinely "real world" examples can be found outside of the well known scientific and engineering applications.  Such a real world situation would require a collection of "rotation" operations that can be combined in <strong>two</strong> different ways: composition (complex number multiplication) and addition.  </p> <p>Circular or periodic phenomena that admit rotations can be found in natural real-life examples, but having any addition operation at all (distinct from performing one rotation after another) is rare enough that it is hard to come up with examples. Having the two operations not only exist but obey the distributive law is very restrictive and seems to happen only in highly structured and mathematized situations whose abstract representation can be reformulated using complex numbers.  </p>
