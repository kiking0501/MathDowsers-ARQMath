<p>I just came across this statement when I was lecturing a student on math and strictly speaking I used: </p> <blockquote> <p>Assuming that the value of <span class="math-container" id="5729406" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> equals &lt;something&gt;, ...</p> </blockquote> <p>One of my students just rose and asked me:</p> <blockquote> <p>Why do we assume so much in math? Is math really built on assumptions?</p> </blockquote> <p>I couldn't answer him, for, as far as I know, a lot of things are just assumptions. For example:</p> <ul> <li><span class="math-container" id="5729407" visual_id="363024"><math alttext="1/\infty" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> equals zero,</li> <li><span class="math-container" id="5729408" visual_id="27695"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></semantics></math></span> is <span class="math-container" id="5729409" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span>, etc.</li> </ul> <p>So would you guys mind telling whether math is built on assumptions?</p>

At the turn of the 20th Century people were building systems of axioms (that is, assumptions) to try and formalise what they saw in every day life. The Peano axioms formalise the natural numbers, and so on. However, Kurt Goedel proved that this approach wasn't as solid a foundation as people had hoped, so I understand that people who work in the foundations of maths have been looking elsewhere. But I don't know. I am a group theorist. Four axioms rule my life. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1176924"> <span class="math-container" id="5729410" visual_id="51075"><math alttext="i=\sqrt{-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow></semantics></math></span> is a definition, not an assumption. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177082"> @SohamChowdhury Actually, it's *both* because it implicitly assumes that -1 has a square root (which is not true for some number systems like the Reals and the Natural numbers). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177086"> *All* thought and reasoning requires assumptions.

You can look at two aspects of math. One is the real mathematics, e.i. pure mathematics which mathematicians practice simply because it is really interesting (similar to why people study literature, philosophy etc.). The other aspect is what you get out of math. You can put it to great use by applying mathematics in physics and engineering which would have gotten nowhere without math. The second aspect is certainly not wasting time. The first one depends on personal opinion. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1177770"> @PratyushSarkar I think you misread my comment.

<div class="answer">
<div answer_id="553423" id="answer">
<p>Short answer is: No, mathematics is not built on assumptions.</p> <p>First: A lot of times we will write things like "assume that <span class="math-container" id="5729431" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> equals ". And, a lot of times, we simply just mean that if <span class="math-container" id="5729432" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> equals something, then .... That is, we are saying that what every follows is valid when <span class="math-container" id="5729433" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> is . So if you ever find yourself in a situation where you actually have <span class="math-container" id="5729434" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> equal , then you can apply the conclusions.</p> <p>Second: Now that <span class="math-container" id="5729435" visual_id="83403"><math alttext="\frac{1}{\infty}=0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> is not an assumption. It is just wrong. For this to even make sense, you would have to allow dividing with infinity and we usually don't do that (especially in an undergraduate calculus class). Infinity if not a number and we can't divide by it.</p> <p>What we do have is that  <span class="math-container" id="5729436" visual_id="140424"><math alttext="\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{x}=0." class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mo>lim</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> An, unfortunately, many teachers will write that this <em>limit</em> is actually equal to <span class="math-container" id="5729437" visual_id="203692"><math alttext="\frac{1}{\infty}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mfrac></semantics></math></span>. </p> <p>Third: About <span class="math-container" id="5729438" visual_id="19179"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}=i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. This is not an assumption, but a definition. Having the real numbers, we construct the complex numbers. Formally you can define the complex numbers as the set <span class="math-container" id="5729439" visual_id="1645743"><math alttext="\mathbb{C}=\{a+bi\mid a,b\in\mathbb{R}\}." class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>ℂ</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>∣</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><mo>∈</mo><mi>ℝ</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> Here we can take <span class="math-container" id="5729440" visual_id="158"><math alttext="i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi></semantics></math></span> as a symbol and we define the usual addition/subtraction/multiplication/division with the convention that <span class="math-container" id="5729441" visual_id="51087"><math alttext="i^{2}=-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. This makes <span class="math-container" id="5729442" visual_id="1492"><math alttext="\mathbb{C}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℂ</mi></semantics></math></span> into a field. We could also express that <span class="math-container" id="5729443" visual_id="51087"><math alttext="i^{2}=-1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> by writing <span class="math-container" id="5729444" visual_id="19179"><math alttext="\sqrt{-1}=i" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. So, it is all about definitions, not assumptions.</p> <p>Forth: If we are just making assumption in mathematics, my questions would be: what are we <em>assuming</em>? Are we assuming something about reality? Some will point out that "mathematics starts with axioms, so we are starting with something that we don't prove, therefore we must be making assumptions". I would say that this is an unfortunate use of the word assumption. By saying that axioms are assumptions, you are assigning a meaning/value to the terms used in the axioms. That is, you are saying that the terms here are already well-defined and that we are making well-defined statements about them. The problem, if this was the case, is that those statements could be false or true. And axioms are taken as true. They are more like definitions then assumptions. Note also that we don't just have axioms, but we also have defined the rules we use to deduce statements from the axioms. </p> <p>Fifth: So how would I answer your student? First I would point out the above, and then I would tell the student to think about mathematics as a game. When you play a game you first establish the rules. Then you play the game. It doesn't make sense to question the rules. The game is defined as the rules. You can ask whether or not the rules are consistent, but you can't really ask if by having the rules we are making assumptions about the world or reality. This approach of course cuts some of the connection between reality and mathematics. There are, of course reasons for the choice of axioms. And so maybe the good questions is: Why did we take those axioms and not other ones?  Some (see comment below) will point out that the choice of axioms is like picking up the right tool needed. But if you ask that question some mathematicians will claim that you have moved outside the area of mathematics and into philosophy. </p>
