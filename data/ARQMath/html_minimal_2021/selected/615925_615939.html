<p>I've seen a lot of definitions of notions like boundary points, accumulation points, continuity, etc, and axioms for the set of the real numbers. But I have a hard time accepting these as "true" definitions or acceptable axioms and because of this it's awfully hard to believe that I can "prove" anything from them. It feels like I can create a close approximation to things found in calculus, but it feels like I'm constructing a forgery rather than proving.</p> <p>What I'm looking for is a way to discover these things on my own rather than have someone tell them to me. For instance, if I want to derive the area of a circle and I know the definition of <span class="math-container" id="6268786" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span> and an integral, I can figure it out.</p>

What may not be related to the continuity of the function is the disconnectedness of its domain. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297342"> I have never heard of connected, I've only just gotten through Real Analysis MATH 3000 at my university after taking cal 1,2,and 3 along with differential equations along with several chemistry and physics courses that use calculus. I love calculus, but I feel like I'm forced to sort of take claims of Real Analysis on faith and it disturbs me when I have already used calculus a great deal with actual, physical results.  I'm just not seeing how set theory has any kind of precedence as being somehow more fundamental than calculus; it feels like these absurd definitions work only coincidentally. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297345"> @PeteL.Clark The fact that "nice, unbroken curve" has nothing to do with the definition of continuity is because it has nothing to do with it. You are simply telling the students the wrong common language notion. The common language definition of continuity is "values at nearby point approach the value at the point". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297350"> @ABC So what is continuous really, if not anything to do with being broken or unbroken? Obviously the definition involves saying if you can make a spot in the range, you can find an entire spot in the domain that maps inside there. But that's not satisfying. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297355"> @Kainui I already said it in the post immediately above yours: "values at nearby points stay as close as we want to the value at the point". Of course, as always, common language is a bit rough. Another thing to take into account is that the word itself "continuous" shouldn't be the indicator of your intuition. Some names of concepts change over time. The meaning of the common language word can also change over time. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297362"> So to phrase my question another way: if the functions f,g:[R\Q-&gt;R], <span class="math-container" id="6268807" visual_id="6029884"><math alttext="f(x)=(x-2)^{3}/(x-2)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is equal to <span class="math-container" id="6268808" visual_id="6029885"><math alttext="g(x)=(x-2)^{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span> right? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297363"> @Kainui For example, the very same word **continuous** in Latin means *uninterrupted*, but also means *hanging together*. The former meaning may lead us to thing that people calling a function continuous tried to formalize the former meaning, but it is really the latter the one that really fits the definition from Bolzano. It is very likely that when the concept of continuous was invented, those who did it were more familiar with Latin, than we are now. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297368"> @ABC I definitely agree with you, that I shouldn't rely on my intuition here. I guess the problem is I have nothing to rely on at all except that whomever is telling me these definitions isn't lying to me. Suppose a better definition of continuous is slightly more refined than this with one little extra stipulation? How do I *know*. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297372"> @Kainui Definitions are whatever you want them to be. Just like your name is whatever you want it to be.

I hate to try to go down a slippery slope but I feel like that's equivalent to saying that I can define the derivative of x^2 to be 3x instead of 2x. But upon looking we can definitely see that the slope will be 2x despite our attempt at redefining it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297382"> @Kainui If derivative has already been defined the fact that the derivative of <span class="math-container" id="6268817" visual_id="513"><math alttext="x^{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> is <span class="math-container" id="6268816" visual_id="2111"><math alttext="2x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is not a definition, it is a deduction. This is very different. Now, when you are defining derivative you can put many different definitions. Actually, there are definitions of derivatives that do not agree with each other (for more complicated object than <span class="math-container" id="6268817" visual_id="513"><math alttext="x^{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></semantics></math></span>).

You are simply telling the students the wrong common language notion." I don't want to start an argument, and your dismissive attitude to my teaching doesn't make me want to continue the conversation.  So I will suffice with the remark that there are certainly sound mathematical grounds to think about continuous real functions in terms of connectedness of the graph: see e.g. "Continuous Functions and Connected Graphs" by C.E. Burgess. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297395"> @ABC Thanks, you're helping me really understand and I appreciate it a lot, but I'm not quite where I'd like to be yet. So now you've got me on board and I see how definitions are different from deductions. Now, is there a way of proving that our definitions aren't somehow contradictory? A kind of meta-real-analysis? My intuition is telling me any time you have more than one definition, you have two possibilities: that they have a possibility of being either contradictory in some unanticipated way or they could both be stated better as one single definition. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297398"> @Kainui: As you go on in mathematics you will meet many concepts which can be given several different-looking but ultimately equivalent definitions.  Really one mark of the naturalness of a mathematical concept is that there are several ways to capture it via a formal definition.  Comparing different definitions to each other and discovering that they are equivalent in one context but not another is a big part of mathematics (and especially, learning mathematics).... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297400"> ...It is natural to want to "synthesize" different definitions into a common definition and sometimes good things come of this, but it is also very often the case that the various definitions have merits that do not completely subsume the other.  Perhaps the first good example of this in mathematics is **the determinant**.  When you study it you can hardly get away with just seeing just one definition: really one needs at least three or so in order to be able to use it properly. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297402"> @PeteL.Clark I just said that you are saying to your students is wrong (which you also said in your own post), and telling you which should be one way of talking about continuity using common language. Read also my post about the meaning of *continuus* in Latin, and how the name could have been adopted because it meant *hanging together* and not *uninterrupted*. The fact that continuous functions map connected to connected is as relevant as continuous functions preserving any other property. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297408"> @Kainui Definitions cannot lead to contradictions (below we discuss when it can happen). Defining something is like name-calling. If you give names to people in any way there is not problem. The only thing that can happen is if someone else also gives names and uses names different from yours. Or if you got confused and gave the same person two different names. In the same way, as long as your definition is not calling the same function continuous and not-continuous at the same time. There is no problem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297411"> @ABC: A function <span class="math-container" id="6268824" visual_id="3106"><math alttext="f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>ℝ</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is continuous if and only if its graph is connected and closed.  This is a formalization of the pre-formal idea that a function is continuous when its graph is a "nice, unbroken curve".  So why do you insist on saying that I am telling students something which is *wrong*?  I have also spent years honing ways to talk about <span class="math-container" id="6268825" visual_id="46"><math alttext="\epsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ϵ</mi></semantics></math></span>-<span class="math-container" id="6268849" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span> in ways which will make some sense to students.  In my experience if you just say "values at nearby points approach the value at the point", then most students take little or nothing from this.... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297413"> If you want to give your actual name and talk about your own teaching experiences and techniques, so be it: it is very likely that I could learn something useful from that.  But criticism from an anonymous internet entity is not appealing to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297415"> That is your own problem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297417"> @PeteL.Clark I can definitely agree. However, these definitions may take you to the right answer, but is there a better way? Is this way "right" or only coincidentally, since we knew the correct outcome? I feel like Real Analysis approaches math as if it's created, not discovered. I mean, where does logic come from in the first place? I don't quite believe there's a platonic realm out there, but by just seeing how well math models physical reality, it seems that math is something we're not just defining and inventing, but discovering. On top of that, not ever using complex numbers disturbs me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297420"> @Kainui: All of the questions in your last comment are great.  They are however well beyond the scope of a site like this to answer.  I recommend that you find a math professor that you like to talk to you and try to explore these issues with her. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297424"> Well, thanks, and damn. I just get furiously angry whenever I think of Real Analysis and I just visualize Real Analysis using all these words such as "real" and "proof" when in reality all numbers are imaginary and the things they put forth as proof is really just passing the buck by tucking infinity away into an epsilon or whatever and hoping you're not clever enough to figure out what new assumptions have been made... At any rate, thanks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1297590"> @kainui : people prove (no quotation marks needed) things using the epsilon-delta definition of the limit all the time, as well as the definitions of the other things you mentioned at the beginning of your questions.  Just crack open a real analysis book and read a proof.  People computed things like areas under a curve without rigorous definitions long ago, but mathematics advanced a lot farther after rigorous definitions were found for the ideas people were using.  Intuition and hand-waving have their place, but are no substitute for rigor. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1300649"> @StefanSmith, the idea that the infinitesimal approach to continuity and other concepts of the calculus amounts to "hand-waiving" was blown out of the water by Abraham Robinson fifty years ago or in 1961 to be more precise, but not everybody noticed. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1300718"> @StefanSmith I'm not denying the value of rigor. I'm denying that Real Analysis is capable of supplying a foundation sturdy enough to produce anything of rigor. It seems made up, rather than discovered. For instance, suppose I have prime numbers and you start defining something that only uses numbers that end in 1,3,7, and 9. Sure they will be coincidentally similar and with a few extra modifications to this list we can "construct" the prime numbers. This is how I view set theory's relation to calculus. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1509154"> @Kainui: The key insight is that if you can come up with approximations to something, then there is a thing that you are approximating. If you come up with approximations in such a way that there is only one thing they could possibly be approximating, then *voila*: you have performed an *exact* computation. This was known at least as far back as the ancient Greeks, e.g. in the form of the principle of exhaustion. For example, if the area of a circle is smaller than any number greater than <span class="math-container" id="6268829" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span> and larger than any number less than <span class="math-container" id="6268829" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span>, then it must be exactly <span class="math-container" id="6268829" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr>

However, there are two separate tracks for the development of analysis: the Archimedean, or A-track, in the context of the real continuum, where the epsilon, delta definition belongs; and the Bernoullian, or B-track, in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum.  The definition Cauchy gave was a B-track definition.  In fact, the definition of continuity over the hyperreal contiuum is identical with Cauchy's.  This point was already made by Robinson in his 1966 book. Thus, Cauchy's definition was not a step... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1364527"> ...toward a Weierstrassian epsilon, delta definition of continuity, but rather a step toward a rigorous infinitesimal definition as ultimately formalized by Hewitt, Los, and Robinson. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1457684"> @user18921: Thanx! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1458403"> You're welcome! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2559427"> @YiorgosS.Smyrlis : I find it alleged on meta that you will not receive any notification of my comments at the URL below.
