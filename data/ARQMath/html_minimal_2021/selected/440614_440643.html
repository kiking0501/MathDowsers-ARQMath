<p>I was trying to teach my younger sister some math, and it drifted on to integers, and operations on negative integers. So questions like:</p> <p>a) <span class="math-container" id="4639935" visual_id="298724"><math alttext="-3+2=\qvar@construct{$}\par" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi mathcolor="red" mathvariant="italic">qvar_$</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span></p> <p>b) <span class="math-container" id="4639936" visual_id="298725"><math alttext="2-(-3)=\qvar@construct{$}\par" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi mathcolor="red" mathvariant="italic">qvar_$</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span></p> <p>c)<span class="math-container" id="4639937" visual_id="298726"><math alttext="g(x,y)=2x^{2}-y" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span></p> <p>had to be answered. So, I did not want to say that because minus of minus is plus, so the answer to b) is 5, and minus of plus is minus, so you can solve a) and c) likewise....and I explained in detail how we can simplify these and for b) particularly, I said:</p> <p>Think of 2 as <span class="math-container" id="4639938" visual_id="298727"><math alttext="5-3" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> then <span class="math-container" id="4639939" visual_id="298728"><math alttext="5-3-(-3)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is the question. Now, I can say that is the same as <span class="math-container" id="4639940" visual_id="298729"><math alttext="5+0-3-(-3)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> and by the definition of <span class="math-container" id="4639941" visual_id="2087"><math alttext="-3" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="4639942" visual_id="298730"><math alttext="0-3=(-3)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, So now the expression becomes; <span class="math-container" id="4639943" visual_id="298731"><math alttext="5+(-3)-(-3)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> and since <span class="math-container" id="4639944" visual_id="298732"><math alttext="(-3)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> is being added and subtracted, we will just cancel that and write 5. So, that is your answer!</p> <p>But I think this is a little too long so I said that you should observe this pattern and then use the result <span class="math-container" id="4639945" visual_id="298733"><math alttext="-(-x)=x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> and solve questions. </p> <p>To see if she has really understood, I asked her to explain this to my mother, and the result was not satisfactory. So, my question is, How can I better explain it to her? Or rather, does this have any flaw which needs to be corrected? </p> <p>Please suggest a method that will involve only basic algebra as she is in grade 4...</p> <p>Aslo, if you find an easier way, do share it with me!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> <p>PS: I think the tags I added are not right, but thats all I could think of, so if I have gone wrong, do edit that.</p>

<p>Basically addition and subtraction is just the same. Subtraction is just addition with negative numbers.</p> <p>There are several ways to remember operations with signed integers:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>First way (common way taught in school):</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><em>(I used to tutor a 5th grade student who is having a difficult time with math. This is the technique I thought of that time and I think she mastered solving operations with signed integers.)</em></p> <p>There are <strong>three rules</strong>: (I ask her every time we solve a similar problem if what rule can we apply to solve it)</p> <p><strong>RULE 1. Addition with same signs:</strong></p> <p>RULE: When <strong><em>adding</em></strong> two integers with the <strong><em>same sign</em></strong> we just <strong><em>add the "absolute value"</em></strong> (or the numbers disregarding their signs) and <strong><em>copy the sign to the sum.</em></strong></p> <p><em>To make it easier for her to understand, it is like adding normal unsigned integers and the "sign" is just an identifier.</em></p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>a. -2 **+** -4 = -6 b. 2 **+** 4 = 6 </code></pre> <p><em>Imagine the plus sign being bold so as to remember that it is an operator. The sum depends on the addends on both sides of the operator. The two addends are independent and the plus sign will merge them depending on their signs.</em></p> <p><strong>RULE 2. Addition with different signs:</strong></p> <p>RULE: If both addends have <strong><em>opposing signs</em></strong>, <strong><em>subtract the "absolute value"</em></strong> of the larger number with the smaller number and <strong><em>copy the sign of the larger number</em></strong>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>a. -7 **+** 3 = -4 (7-3=4 and the sign of the bigger number which is 7 is negative) b. 7 **+** -3 = 4 (7-3=4 and the sign of the bigger number which is 7 is positive) </code></pre> <p><strong>RULE 3. Subtraction with same or opposite sign:</strong></p> <p>RULE: <strong><em>Change the sign of the subtrahend</em></strong> (second operand e.g. negative becomes positive) and <strong><em>proceed to addition</em></strong> (make the minus operation a plus operation.</p> <p><em><strong>All rules for addition can be applied here.</strong></em></p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p><strong>To sum up:</strong></p> <p>ADDITION:  <strong>a.</strong> same sign - normal addition but copy the sign common to   the addends  <strong>b.</strong> opposite sign - normal subtraction of the same number   but copy the sign of the bigger number</p> <p>SUBTRACTION:  -change the sign of the second operand and proceed to   addition.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <blockquote> <p><strong>SECOND WAY/SHORTCUT:</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>As I stated earlier, addition and subtraction is just the same. It is just addition with integers where one or both of the addends can be negative.</p> <p>Consider all subtraction as addition and refer below:</p> <p>a. 3 - 7 (this is basically subtraction at first glance)</p> <pre><code>Consider it this way  3 + (-7)  there is an imaginary plus sign (addition between 3 and -7)  since 3 and -7 have opposite signs we use RULE 2.  3 - 7 = 3 + (-7) = -4 </code></pre> <p>b. -4 - 8</p> <pre><code>can be written as   (-4) + (-8)  placing a parenthesis or thinking of the negative sign and the number itself as one entity really helps  -4 - 8 = (-4) + (-8) = - 12  from RULE 1 </code></pre> <p>Hope this helps :)</p> <p><strong>EDIT As you noticed above, I focused on the operation addition since subtraction is based on addition. It is the most fundamental operation. We were taught from school that addition and subtraction is just moving to the right and left in a number line. I think that is the most intuitive way to do simple arithmetic on signed numbers for beginners ;)</strong></p> <p>Furthermore, I believe that doing Math is more of a gut feeling. You don't have to analyze every time you perform an operation the logic behind things. Plus, it's time consuming. Of course at first you have to but once you get a feel with what you are doing, solving problems will just come naturally. That's why I outlined these simple steps.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="945190"> Thanks a ton for such a long response, but I have a basic doubt here. Aren't you just giving the rules and asking the student to learn them? I wanted it to be intuitive and not memory based, so I think I need to give a "proof." Of these rules to the student. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="945801"> I agree with Saurabh that this is basically relies on a student accurately applying rules established by fiat. This certainly is the tack taken by most American primary/secondary schools, but such an approach seems to have pedagogical problems. Students begin to expect math is *all* memorization and application of such rules. I think Saurabh is looking for some appealing physical metaphor to try to *convey the idea* rather than the rules. Once the idea is established, a student can figure out many of the rules themselves (a *much* better result :) ) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="945919"> @rschwieb, hit the nail on the head, my friend! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1086377"> @SaurabhRaje you can utilize the number line. That is how I first learned to add signed numbers. Addition is done by moving through the number line to the right. Likewise, subtraction is done by going to the left of the number line ;) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1086405"> @SaurabhRaje you can first explain the concept of a number line. It is also useful to present these numbers in terms of money. It is easier to visualize arithmetic this way. I assumed that since you are working with addition and subtraction with signed numbers that your student already know the basics about addition and integers. </td></tr>
