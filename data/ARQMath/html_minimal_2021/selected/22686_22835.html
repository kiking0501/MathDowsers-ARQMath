<p>The ancient discipline of construction by straightedge and compass is both fascinating and entertaining. But what is its significance in a mathematical sense? It is still taught in high school geometry classes even today. </p> <p>What I'm getting at is this: Are the rules of construction just arbitrarily imposed restrictions, like a form of poetry, or is there a meaningful reason for prohibiting, say, the use of a protractor?</p>

<tr><td comment_id="49138"> There is a lot taught in high school with little reason for it; they should stop teaching trigonometry and instead do some intro statistics (at the level of, say, **How to Lie With Statistics**); geometric constructions with straightedge and compass are likely a remnant of the time when instruction in geometry was viewed more as a way to "exercise the mind" of the student than because it is significant or useful in any way. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49152"> http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49177"> @Qiaochu: Yes, I know. But the purpose of instruction in high school includes preparing the individual for the world, not just introducing them to the wonders of knowledge and science. A good intro to statistics, or a good discrete math/intro to logic course does not have to be a drudgery of rules, or pure results-oriented, but it would give the students something which they really do need in the world. We don't just teach children to read so that they can enjoy the wonders of Shakespeare, but because to function in society they must read; today, they should understand basic statistics! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49180"> Trig is extremely important for physics, engineering and, last but not least, mathematics. And even if your children don't care for any of these, they probably care for video games, and, oh wonder, it's of much use there too. I think it's a really bad example of a piece of mathematics that can be dropped from the curriculum. However, I completely agree with the OP that compass-and-ruler constructions are almost useless as of today and can be dropped.

What have non-intersecting circles done that justifies this complication? Algebraically, the radical axis is a rational object, and there should be no reason to distinguish cases according to whether circles intersect or not. By solving rational problems in irrational ways (i. e. taking the two points of intersection of two circles - this comes down to solving a quadratic equation), compass-and-ruler constructions are solving easy problems in artificially complicated ways.

I am not, as your first comment suggests, however, saying that constructions are useless and should be dropped. When I ask "What's the point?", I'm asking out of genuine curiosity and not trying to make an editorial statement. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49252"> This to me is like asking what is the point of music? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49256"> I believe euclid's answer to a similar question was: "give this man an obolus, as he must make gain of everything he learns." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49258"> @darij: I'm not saying trig is not important for later studies; I just don't know why we teach it in high school, and not through JITT ("Just In Time Teaching") in those later studies. I'm no suggesting dropping trig from **all** curricula, but why do we teach middle and high school students to solve triangles? Students coming out of **high school** need to be literate (able to read and comprehend what they read, able to write coherently) and numerate; again, we don't teach them to read because they should know Shakespeare or to show them how cool poetry is. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49261"> @darij: *I* learned all the trig I know either in JITT in calculus class (which introduced the functions from the ground up, as the parametrization of the unit circle), or by having to teach pre-calculus (I had never "solved a triangle" before then, nor was this any particular obstacle to my education). By all means, trig is important for physics, engineering, video-gaming, etc. It should be taught to *them*. Measure theory is extremely important for statistics and probability, we don't demand that it be taught to everyone. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49456"> @Arturo: that wasn't intended to be a response to your comment, but a response to the OP. I totally agree with your comment. But Lockhart (if I am remembering correctly) points out, among other things, that high school geometry exists for historical reasons and that it is being parroted without a real understanding of its point, or something like that. Perhaps I should have pointed this out. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49459"> @Qiaochu: Sorry if I seemed to be jumping at you. A subject of frequent frustation for me, as you can probably guess from my rant below. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="88932"> From Stukeley's memoir on Newton: "he never observed [Newton] to laugh but once. 'twas upon occasion of asking a friend to whom he had lent Euclid to read, what progress he had made in that author, &amp; how he liked him? he answerd, by desiring to know what use &amp; benefit in life that study would be to him? upon which Sir Isaac was very merry." </td></tr>

<div answer_id="22835" id="answer">
<p>Okay, I seem to be ranting too much in comments, so let me try to put forth my points and opinion here (as a community wiki, since it is opinion). </p> <p>First, to address the question: What is the significance of straightedge and compass constructions within mathematics? Historically, they played an important role and led to a number of interesting material (the three famous impossibilities lead very naturally to transcendental numbers, theories of equations, and the like). They are related to fascinating stuff (numbers constructible by origami, etc). But I would say that their significance parallels a bit the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/10029/10034#10034">significance of Cayley's Theorem</a> in Group Theory: although important historically, and relevant to understand the development of many areas of mathematics, they are not that particularly important today. As you can see from the responses, many find them "fascinating", many find them "boring", but nobody seems to have come forth with an important application.</p> <p>Now, addressing the issue of teaching it at K-12. Let me preface this by saying that I am a "survivor" of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math" rel="nofollow noreferrer">New Math</a>, which came to Mexico (where I grew up) in the 70s. I would say I became a mathematician in large part <em>despite</em> having been taught with New Math, rather than <em>because</em> of it. Also, I did not attend K-12 education or undergraduate in the U.S.; I am a bit more familiar with undergraduate at the level of precalculus and above thanks to my job, but not very much with the details of curricula in sundry states in the U.S. So I may very well have a wrong impression of details in what follows.</p> <p>Now, one problem, in my view, is that when we talk about "math education", we are really talking about <em>two</em> different things: numeracy and mathematics. This is the same phenomenon we see when we think about "English class". I suspect that English Ph.D.s are nonplussed at people who think they spend their time dealing with grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc, just as mathematicians are nonplussed that people think we spend our time multiplying really big numbers by hand. English education has two distinct components, which we might call "Literacy" and "Literature". Literacy is the component where we try to teach students to read and write effectively, spelling, punctuation, etc. Making themselves understood in written form, and understanding the written word. On the other hand, Literature is the component where they are introduced to Shakespeare, novelists, book reading, short stories, poetry, creative writing, historical and world literature, etc. We consider English education at our schools a failure when it fails in its mission with regards to <strong>literacy</strong>: we don't consider it a failure if students come out not being particularly enthused with reading classic novels or don't become professional poets, or even if they don't care or like poetry (or Shakespeare).  The professional English Ph.D. engages in literature, not in literacy. Literacy is the domain of the grammarian.</p> <p>Mathematics education likewise has two components; numeracy (to borrow the term from John Allen Paulos) and mathematics. Numeracy is the parallel of literacy: we want children to be able to handle and understand numbers and basic algebra, percentages, etc., because they are necessary to function in the world. Mathematics is the stuff that mathematicians do, and which we all find so interesting and beautiful. </p> <p>"Mathematics" also includes advanced topics that are necessary for someone who is going to go on to study areas that require mathematics: so the physicists and engineers need to know trigonometry; business and economists need to know advanced statistics; computer science needs to know discrete mathematics; etc. Much like someone going on to college likely needs more than simple command of grammar and spelling. </p> <p>Part of the problem with math education is that it so often conflates numeracy with mathematics; another part of the problem is that mathematics was included in the "classical" curriculum for much the same reason as Latin and Greek were included: historical reasons, because every "gentleman" was expected to know some Latin, some Greek, and some mathematics (and by "mathematics", people meant Euclid). To some extent, we still teach geometry in K-12 because we've always taught geometry. But it is not part of the numeracy curriculum.</p> <p>It would be wonderful if we had the time in K-12 to teach students <em>both</em> numeracy and mathematics; it is a fact that today we are failing at both. We don't perform better in teaching students numeracy by teaching them beautiful mathematics, even if they understand and appreciate them, just like making them really understand and care for Shakespeare's plays (through performance, say) will make them able to understand a set of written instructions, or write a coherent argument.</p> <p>Trying to excite students about mathematics is all well and good; but numeracy should come first. Trying to excite students about the wonderful world of books, plays, and poetry is all well and good, but we need them to be able to read and write first, because that's part of what they will need to function in society.</p> <p>Constructions by straightedge and compass can become an interesting part of <em>mathematics</em> education, just like geometry. I just don't think they have a place in <em>numeracy</em> education. But they are taking the time we need for that numeracy education. Trigonometry <em>used to be</em> part of the numeracy education that people needed; this is no longer the case today. Trigonometry, today, is a foundational science for more advanced studies, not part of numeracy. But we are still teaching trigonometry as a numeracy subject (hence the rules, recipes, mnemonics, and the like). We could try to turn trigonometry into a <em>mathematical</em> subject, sure; or we could postpone it until later and only teach it to those for whom it is an important foundation. </p> <p><em>Added.</em> To clarify: I don't mean to say that the "solution" is to do less math and more numeracy. I think the solution is likely to be complicated, but the first step is to identify exactly what parts of what is currently branded as "mathematics" are really numeracy, and which parts are mathematics. Trigonometry is taught as part of "advanced mathematics", but it is taught as rote and rules because it was really numeracy. We don't need to teach trigonometry as numeracy any more, so we shouldn't. If it is to be taught, it needs to be taught in the right context. Geometry is similar: geometry used to be taught as basic numeracy because "every educated person should know geometry"; (of course, "educated" at the time meant "rich and land owner, or with aspirations in that direction"). We don't need most of geometry as basic numeracy, we want it now as mathematics. So teaching geometry <em>as</em> numeracy is a waste of time, and it takes up the <em>numeracy</em> time that should be spent in other things. (It can still be taught during the <em>mathematics</em> time). I certainly don't say "drop all the math, concentrate on the numeracy". I say, "when dealing with numeracy, concentrate on the numeracy, not the math, and don't confuse the two." Nobody seems to confuse spelling rules with reading novels, because we separate literacy from literature. Too many people confuse arithmetic with mathematics, because we don't separate them.</p> <p>The reason I talk about dropping trigonometry and doing some basic statistics is precisely that: trigonometry is being taught as part of the <em>numeracy</em> curriculum, when it shouldn't. Basic statistics, say at the level of the wonderful <strong>How to Lie With Statistics</strong>, is not taught as part of numeracy. But in today's world, there is a far better case for statistics being part of the basic numeracy education than trigonometry. Everyone coming out of High School <em>should know</em> that taking a 10% pay-cut and then getting a 5% raise does not mean you are now at 95% of your old salary (go do a spot check, see how many people think you <em>are</em>). They need to know the difference between <em>average</em> and <em>median</em>, so they are not misled by statements about "the average salary of the American worker". They should understand what "false positive" and "false negative" means. They should be able to interpret graphs (even the silly ones on the cover of every <em>USA Today</em> issue) and be able to spot the distortions created by chopping axes, etc. These are <em>numeracy</em> issues. </p> <p>Likewise high school geometry: it is trying to be both numeracy and mathematics, and I think it generally fails at both. There are some components of geometry that are part of numeracy, they ought to be treated that way, but the parts that are mathematics should be separate.</p> <p>One problem I have with Lockhart's lament is that he does not make clear the distinction between numeracy and mathematical education. The nightmare he paints for the musician and the artist is precisely that musical education is being turned into the equivalent of numeracy/literacy education, thus doing a disservice to music-as-an-art. </p> <p>The science of mathematics that we all know and love has some intersection with numeracy and arithmetic, but we all know it is a limited intersection; just as the study of literature has some intersection with the study of grammar an spelling, but the intersection is limited. The main purpose of K-12 education (or at the very least, K-6 or K-8) should be <em>numeracy</em>, with some limited forays into mathematics (just as the main purpose will be <em>literacy</em> with some limited forays into <em>literature</em>). The way to teach numeracy is necessarily different from the way to teach mathematics. Numeracy requires that we memorize multiplication tables, for all the horror this will cause to modern education people; this of course is a far cry from teaching the <em>mathematics</em> of multiplication, which may very well be very interesting and awaken the child's curiosity and wonder at the world. That can be done within the context of <em>mathematical</em> education, but it shouldn't be done in the context, and at the expense of, numeracy.</p> <p>Trigonometry used to be part of numeracy; it no longer is. It is now either mathematical or foundational for advanced studies, so it should be treated as such. Geometry used to be taught for reasons which no longer hold, and to some extent we continue teaching it as a historical legacy; we shouldn't. Those components which are numeracy should be taught as that, and we could move the rest (including constructions with compass and straightedge) to the more creative, mathematical education side of the equation. </p> <p>Anyway, I've ranted long enough, and probably made myself a few detractors along the way...</p>

<tr><td comment_id="49470"> +1; couldn't agree more. Paul Graham wrote an interesting essay which is in some sense also about the distinction between literacy and literature here: http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html . As far as I can tell, this extremely important point about statistics is not being made to the people who actually decide math curricula... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49536"> I <span class="math-container" id="525117">t</span>hink that the main <span class="math-container" id="525118">f</span>law in the above argument is the assumption that, in trying to strike a balance between numeracy and mathematics, the main mechanism is to do less of one thing in favour of the other. The point is that if you don't show students that maths lessons can be fun and creative, you will not be able to teach them numeracy! They will just find everything you do boring (rightly so!) and will block off any sort of knowledge that you try to hurl at them. Geometric constructions are already on the "more creative side of the equation", and as such, they are important. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49544"> @Alex: Are we unable to teach students to read and write if we don't teach them that reading can be fun and creative? I don't think so. Are we unable to teach grammar and spelling unless we show them how much fun ee cummings ahd with punctutation? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49545"> @Alex: And let me try to clear up something: I'm not saying at all that to strike a balance we need to do less of one or more of the other. I think the main problem is that when we fail to distinguish between the two, we do a disservice to *both*; we don't teach students to read and write by having them plow through Chaucer, and we don't teach them creative writing by having them memorize grammar rules. If you identify which parts are numeracy and which parts are mathematics, then you can try to create an effective teaching method; but if you confuse them, you are lost from the outset. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49580"> @Alex: I think I see where you got that impression. Let me clear that up. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49602"> @Arturo You ask "Are we unable to teach students to read and write if we don't teach them that reading can be fun and creative?" I believe that the answer is "yes, we are unable to". One can drill very basic reading skills into students, but my experience is that the reading of people who don't start reading books at some point is below the level required to e.g. quickly skim read a news paper. In short, they will be able to read signs on the bus stop, but they will not learn what I call reading. It may sound absurd if you don't know such people,... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49603"> ... but I have really seen people finish school in Germany without being able to read properly (as in stuttering when trying to read several connected sentences and being completely exhausted after half a page). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49717"> I agree wholeheartedly with Alex. It sounds completely possible that people can "learn" to do certain basic skills, but if we want them to actually learn the skill with any reasonable meaning of that word, then they have to have some sort of interest or excitement about it. The music analogy is perfect here. No one will sit around drilling scale and arpeggio exercises unless they've heard the amazing things experts can do on an instrument and want to get there themselves. No one. It is just too tedious and boring without knowing the payoff ahead of time. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49729"> @Alex, @Matt; After some thought I ended up agreeing part with you on that. But there is one issue that bothers me: we can teach to read and write by making *reading* and *writing* fun (e.g., Sesame Street); we don't do it by showing them that there's other stuff which is fun, dangling it in front of them, and then telling them that they need to learn the boring parts of spelling and grammar because they are a prerequisite for the fun part. But it seems that this is the strategy proposed for teaching numeracy. (cont) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49731"> @Alex, @Matt: (cont) Show them the fun parts of math, so that they'll be interested, then hit them with the boring stuff. By separating the "math" form the "numeracy", and developing ways of teaching *numeracy* effectively, you can accomplish more than by conflating them, showing them fun stuff with "math", and then telling them they have to learn the numeracy to get to the fun stuff. Perhaps this analogy: kids will do their chores better if you make the *chores* fun than if you say "do your chores, then you can play"; or than by calling the chores "baseball" hoping they'll think its a game. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="49737"> @Matt: The reason the music analogy is *not* perfect is that music *is* a completely optional skill set, numeracy is *not*. Music works, but only partially, as an analogy for *mathematical* education, but fails utterly for numeracy. Numeracy is a skill set that is like literacy, not like music. And the problem with the analogy of music with mathematical education is that nobody needs musical skills in order to do stuff outside of music, but many people need mathematical skills to do stuff outside of mathematics (physics, computer science, medicine, etc). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2587983"> I disagree with your opi<span class="math-container" id="23931186">n</span>ion that trig should be dropped.
