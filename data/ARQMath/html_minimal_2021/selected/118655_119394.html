<tr><td comment_id="275424"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275519"> It all depends on how mathematical this non-mathematician is.  For the less mathematical I honestly think the simplest way would involve using Cantor‚ÄìBernstein‚ÄìSchroeder and phrasing the two halves as "there are no more reals than sets of naturals" and _vice versa_.  I think CBS is a theorem that a non-mathematician could be convinced of without too much difficulty; not with anything that would approach mathematical rigour, mind you.  Avoiding CBS seems to involve nitty-gritty details that would make the average non-mathematician glassy-eyed, and the heart of the ideas might become lost. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275526"> I completely agree with Arthur, moreover to the non-mathematician the fact that there are two different sizes of infinity (countable and uncountable) would already make them glassy-eyed and you'd lose them completely. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275544"> The non-mathematmatician in question is VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH non-mathematical, so that expressions like "arctan (x)" (or even the "tan (x)" itself!) don't shed much of a light to his picture. So I would very much appreciate as little of symbols of any kind as possible - maybe NONE? - and as much convenient "images" as one is capable of providing without reffering to, say, the Bible. Thanks in advance, J. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275553"> Wrong, Asaf: That there are different sizes of infinity, proven by, say, the diagonal argument, is totaly acceptable, moreover, easy to understand for me. But I do have troubles understanding mathematical symbols and notations. So if there is an explanation that resembles the diagonal agument - which in my eyes is more of a picture than anything else - than that would be the kind of an answer I'm hoping for. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275577"> @Jan: I am a set theorist. It's not that my research focuses on finding "roots of polynomials" and whatnot. In particular I deal in my M.Sc. with behavior of cardinals in the absence of the axiom of choice. I always enjoy trying explaining those to people, especially other barflies at the local pub. It is *very* baffling to people that there are different sizes of infinity. It is equally baffling when you see it for the first time *with* the full definitions and proofs, people telling you otherwise are likely to lack the actual understanding - and further discussion is just further confusing. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275579"> Also if you want an under that *you* can understand, this is a **very** different situation than asking "*I have to explain this fact to a bunch of folks in a few days, how should I approach that?*". Mostly because *you* can add to the question what *you* already know and understand on the topic. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275580"> @Jan Some theorems admit a "proof by picture," where you a give a convincing proof-sketch without actually writing anything down, but most theorems do not have proofs that fall under this category.  Something like "There is a bijection between <span class="math-container" id="1377656" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñù</mi></semantics></math></span> and the set of all subsets of <span class="math-container" id="1377584" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span>" will almost certainly involve at least a few steps and some non-trivial terminology. That doesn't mean it's complicated (it's just the composition of a few "nice" bijections), it's just not as basic as most ideas encountered in high school. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275643"> Asaf: Of course, it is ME that is need of a proof. My profession is   (german classical) philosophy (mostly Kant and Hegel), but I'm studying Alain Badou now (a french philosopher that talks about ZFC set theory a lot), so I wish to claryfy some basic things. I understand the diagonal argument proving that there is a number that cannot be presented anywhere in the "No infinitely" stretching list of, say, real segments between 0 and 1, etc. but I had another problem: </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275650"> since I was informed, that Cantor could "collect" the set of R only by interpreting it as a power set of N, and since I was also informed that that was his basic motif for the introduction of the "power set" axiom in the first place, I just wanted to know, how can one grasp the mentioned equality without any profound mathematical knowledge - and since the "diagonalization" seemed acceptably cogent to me, I was just wandering if there could be the same case with the equasion of cardinalitys between R and P(N). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275653"> @Jan: Very good then, you should *edit* the relevant information into the question. What you know and don't know. Sure it is a very general situation right now, and mathematicians strive to solve the most general situation, but first we start with the situation at hand - then we generalize the solution. So please, add the relevant information to the question to reflect that it is *you* who is trying to understand, and not that you need to explain to *someone else*, since you're not mathematically trained I'd consider adding  a short list of what you already know about set theory. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275674"> @Jan:  You're studying Badiou?!  This might be causing problems later since I know that he also uses the concept of [forcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_%28mathematics%29) in his work (at least in "_Being and Event_", which I guess the original French would be "_L'√ätre et l'√âv√©nement_").  (When I discovered that some philosopher was using set theory in his philosophical work I sought it out, but utterly failed to make sense of it.  This is likely due to my lack of any real philosophical background.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="275920"> @Jan: Diagonal arguments are good for showing that certain things _cannot_ exist (or in rare and subtle cases that things which do exist cannot have certain properties, like the G√∂del sentence having a proof). However here you must show that a bijection _does_ exist, so a diagonal argument won't be of avail. Also for technical reasons (as ordered sets <span class="math-container" id="1377633" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñù</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="1377631" visual_id="126398"><math alttext="\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ùí´</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>‚Ñï</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> have fundamentally different properties), such a bijection cannot be entirely "smooth". Which explains what an effortless proof is not possible. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276126"> @Artur Fischer: I'm not worrying about the "forcing" too much since Badiou explains the general idea in farly siple terms. But the bijection I'm asking for is not explained there so I was simply qurious: If the P(N) is the most obvious way to mathematically discribe the continuum in terms of exemplifying it by N numbers, how can this be done in terms understandable to a non-mathematician, i.e. to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276149"> If you just want to describe <span class="math-container" id="1377656" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñù</mi></semantics></math></span> in terms of <span class="math-container" id="1377584" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span> then it's a COMPLETELY different question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276659"> @you: I realy think that such a "describing of R in terms of N" (although I would prefer describing it in terms of P(N)) would be of a great help to me. Could You do it here or should I formulate this as a seperate question? Thanks, J. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276686"> I can give you a brief description in a comment and see if it's what you're looking for.  It's kind of a "call and anser" story.

But is it possible to do something simmilar with P(N)? To precisize myself: is it possible to intuitively explain why the uncountability of P(N) is not "bigger" nor "smaller" than the uncountability of R? (see cont.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276736"> (cont.) Or by putting the question in historical terms: why did Cantor choose the P(N) - and not, say, just some other set - to compare it to R in the first place? What is it about the P(N), that makes it so appealing to make one starting to prove the bijection in question by it? What is it, that makes one (intuitevily) say: "I want to show just how big the R is - so, heck, why don't I just take the P(N) and start from here?!" I hope that the question is now clear enough. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="276827"> Well, by the diagonalization argument we know that <span class="math-container" id="1377656" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñù</mi></semantics></math></span> is "larger" than <span class="math-container" id="1377584" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span>, and an argument similar to Russel's Paradox tells us that <span class="math-container" id="1377531" visual_id="126398"><math alttext="\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ùí´</mi><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>‚Ñï</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> ALSO "larger" than <span class="math-container" id="1377584" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span>.

If you would like a nonmathematical way of showing two uncountably infinite sets have the same size, I ask: what do "uncountable" and "same size" mean, nonmathematically? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277434"> Khmmm, I'd say you've got a point there... Well, I was wandering if one could go one in pretty much the same way as with the proofs provides for the notions, applied with 1. ("uncountability") the (non-)relation between R and N, shown by the diagonalization, and 2., ("same size") one-to-one correspondence between the natural and even (or odd, or squared, etc.) numbers... All in all I'd say that it was exactly this supposition that drowe me in posing the question in the first place. (see cont.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277440"> (cont.) But since: 1., no argument of this (realy simple) kind was provided in this site (although there were some nice tries), 2.  Marc van Leeuwen (see above) stated that "ordered sets R and P(N) have fundamentally different properties", and 3. I belive You, mathematicians, - I guess finally, the answer to my question would be that it is simply PRINCIPALLY IMPOSSIBLE to demonstrate such an answer in a manner that could be as simple as showing the correspondence of N to one of its subsets (i.e. evens, odds, etc.)? (see cont.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277458"> (cont.) But still further on: since, 1., N cannot be put into the one-to-one correspondence with EACH of it's subsets - i.e. at least not with those that are self-referential (the set of all the "outer" (not-contained) representations of P(N) in N cannot have an adquate representation in N) -, since 2., the diagonal arg. is basically of the same (self-referential) kind, and 3., since both of these arguments combined show ONLY that both P(N) and R are non-countable, but not that they are of the same size: (see cont.) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277465"> (cont.): Then, finaly, I guess the main argument for the impossibility of the intuitive answer to my question would be that there just ain't no way to intuitively grasp still larger incountable set as R (implied that diagonalization counts as intuitive enough to devide the cardinalities of N and R), thus showing the way to divide it from the uncountability of R (and of P(N)). Or is there? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277520"> First let me remark that there is a simple way to show that every infinite subset of <span class="math-container" id="1377648" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span> can be put in one-to-one correspondence with <span class="math-container" id="1377648" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span>.

These two are not very difficult to see and understand. I have to admit that I have absolutely no idea what does that mean for a set to be "self referential" and what is "the set of all the 'outer' representations of P(N) in N". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="277521"> I also have to say that if you plan on making set theory based arguments without studying some set theory first... well, that's just wrong in so many levels. </td></tr>

<p>Here's my attempt to make the steps as mathematically non-threatening as possible, even at the expense of elegance:</p> <p>We start from any real number, and wish to transform it into an unique set of natural numbers, such that every subset of <span class="math-container" id="1377636" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span> is hit exactly once.</p> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Squeeze the real line into the half-open interval between <span class="math-container" id="1377637" visual_id="92"><math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>0</mn></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="1377638" visual_id="342"><math alttext="1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>1</mn></semantics></math></span>:</p> <ul> <li>If the number was <span class="math-container" id="1377639" visual_id="92"><math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>0</mn></semantics></math></span>, then it stays unchanged.</li> <li>If the number was a positive integer <span class="math-container" id="1377640" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span>, then replace it with <span class="math-container" id="1377641" visual_id="54078"><math alttext="\frac{1}{2n}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></mfrac></semantics></math></span>.</li> <li>If the number was a positive non-integer, say <span class="math-container" id="1377642" visual_id="240472"><math alttext="+x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, then replace it with <span class="math-container" id="1377643" visual_id="5059747"><math alttext="\frac{1}{2(x+1)}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></semantics></math></span>.</li> <li>If the number was negative, say <span class="math-container" id="1377644" visual_id="7946"><math alttext="-y" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, then replace it with <span class="math-container" id="1377645" visual_id="8548966"><math alttext="\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2(y+1)}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></semantics></math></span>.</li> </ul> <p>(This is not a particularly nice way to do this, mathematically speaking, but it is easier to understand than many slicker alternatives).</p> <p>Pause. Satisfy yourself that every number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) is hit exactly once.</p> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Write down the decimal fraction for the number. It will start by "<code>0.</code>" followed by a countably infinite sequence of decimals. If you can represent the number exactly with finitely many digits, top it up with infinite repeating <code>0</code>s that the back end. Don't use representations that end in infinitely many '9's.</p> <p>(There's a considerable amount of mathematical sophistication being swept under the rug in this step, but I'm assuming you're intuitively familiar with decimal fractions, and know that <span class="math-container" id="1377646" visual_id="478081"><math alttext="0.999...=1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>0.999</mn><mo>‚Å¢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">‚Ä¶</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span>).</p> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove the initial <code>0.</code>.</p> <p>Pause. Satisfy yourself that every infinite sequence of digits is hit exactly once, <em>except</em> that sequences that end in infinite repeated <code>9</code>s are <em>not</em> hit.</p> <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Encode the digits as ones and zeroes, using a table such as</p> <pre><code>0 becomes 0000    5 becomes 0101 1 becomes 0001    6 becomes 0110 2 becomes 0010    7 becomes 0111 3 becomes 0011    8 becomes 10 4 becomes 0100    9 becomes 11 </code></pre> <p>The precise details of the encoding are not important, except to note that if we encode any sequence of digits in this way, we don't need to keep around any separators between successive digits. You can reconstruct the digits without them, because the first bit of an encoded digit determines whether it's a 4-bit or a 2-bit encoding. Furthermore, a sequence that ends in infinite repeating <code>9</code>s (but only such sequences) would map to a sequence ending in infinite repeating <code>1</code>s.</p> <p>Pause. Satisfy yourself that every infinite sequence of digits is hit exactly once, <em>except</em> that sequences that end in infinite repeated <code>1</code>s are <em>not</em> hit.</p> <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Get the sequences that end in infinite repeated <code>1</code>s included, by this rule:</p> <ul> <li>If the sequence already has infinitely many <code>1</code>s (which must be interspersed with infinitely many <code>0</code>s in some pattern or non-pattern), then leave it as it is.</li> <li>If the sequence only has finitely many <code>1</code>s, <em>and it starts with a <code>0</code></em>, then chop off the initial <code>0</code> and leave it otherwise as it is.</li> <li>If the sequence only has finitely many <code>1</code>s and starts with an <code>1</code>, then chop off the initial <code>1</code>, and <em>flip every remaining element in the sequence from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> or vice versa</em>.</li> </ul> <p>Pause. Satisfy yourself that every infinite sequence of zeroes or ones is hit exactly once, no exceptions.</p> <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Take the subset of <span class="math-container" id="1377647" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span> consisting of the positions in the sequence where an <code>1</code> is found.</p> <p>Satisfy yourself that every subset of <span class="math-container" id="1377648" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñï</mi></semantics></math></span> is hit exactly once.</p>
