Under one possible interpretation it seems to me that it might depend on whether the ruler of the country is sometimes a queen, or is always a king, which would be an interesting twist. </td></tr>

<p>It is unambiguously correct ( assuming odds boy/girl 50-50 &amp; male always king). Only possible family structures: b,b / b,g / g,b - all family structures are equally likely ; therefore probability King having a Sister 2/3 (b/g ; g/b).</p> <p>On the below : " We randomly select a king. Then we are informed that the king has exactly one sibling. What is the probability that the sibling is female?" 1/2 - 1/2 ; But this is not a different interpretation of the same question ; It is a different question !! Because if you randomously select a King, the odds of the King coming from a family with 2 boys rather than a family with one boy, is two times as big. ( and because we know there are two times more families with one boy and one girl ; we get &gt;&gt; b,g/ g,b/ b,b/ b,b AND it is 50-50)  ; or said in a different manner ; now it is possible that the King has an older brother - if the younger brothers would be excluded from the random drawing - it would be 2/3-1/3 again. </p> <p>Few notes for fun : * Are the odds Boy/Girl 50-50 ? * King could be one of identical twins - meaning that there are ( small) odds in favour of b,b ; making the likelihood a little lower ( non identical twins assume normal distribution ; and identical girl twins are not in the possible poule anyway)</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Sytse</p>
