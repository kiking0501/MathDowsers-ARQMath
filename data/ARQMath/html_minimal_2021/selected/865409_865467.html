The usual answer would be that the complex numbers help us solve all real polynomials, but I'm guessing you know that and either way it does not quite answer your particular question.

I'm more concerned with extending the definition of numbers to include complex numbers for example. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1784157"> Perhaps you might want to look up the definition of a "field". I think if you consider a "number" to be an element of some field then this might make you happy, at least for a little while.  It doesn't include the quaternions (they're not commutative for multiplication), but it's pretty good for many purposes, e.g., much of basic linear algebra works over a general field. An even more encompassing definition might be "an element of an algebra over a commutative ring", but division by nonzero elements breaks down at that level, and you might not be prepared to consider such things as numbers. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1784162"> I suppose "an element of an algebraically closed, locally compact, archimedean field." or something of the like would work if you're looking for elements of <span class="math-container" id="8402362" visual_id="1492"><math alttext="\mathbb{C}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚ÑÇ</mi></semantics></math></span>. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1784167"> associative division algebra over the reals     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algebra#Associative_division_algebras </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1784168"> I should add that the term "number" is hopelessly versatile to the point where you're not going to get much of a definition in the vein you're looking for, which seems to be one which would satisfy anyone's idea of a "number" in any context.

It is capable of direction and/or position as expressed in one dimension as signed numbers and in two dimensions as complex numbers and in all other dimensions though not nicely behaved in all. n-adic numbers are an interesting alternative way to represent negative numbers. Then, of course, there are myriad classes of numbers that are also called "numbers" such as prime numbers etc. Numbers can also be used as labels such as indicators of position etc. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1786178"> Oops, I forgot to mention quantity as measurement which uses units and leads to quantity as position and/or location, relative zero, fractions of various kinds, and vectors. And infinity as a sort of quantity. Quantity is physical and an amazing concept. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1790270"> I suppose I may as well point out that in the Mizar mathematical library (a collection of formal computer-verified proofs and definitions), a "number" is defined to be the same as a set, so that you can say "complex number" instead of "complex set", which sounds weird. Basically, by this definition everything is a number, and all the "meaning" is carried by the adjective, i.e. "real", "complex", etc. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1800991"> There is a nice interpretation of complex numbers, at least Gaussian integers, by Leinster and Fiore: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0211454 </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5329307"> I am inclined to think that they are called numbers because they have a ring structure. Things on which one can define things which they _choose_ to call addition or multiplication seem to be well fit for the label "number". </td></tr>

<p>A basic question is, what would be the purpose of such a definition? Would it clarify anything if we came up with a definition that, say, included quaternions and not matrices or analytic functions? </p> <p>Most of the usages of the term "number" are due to historical choices that have lived on. I'd be interested in seeing things that were called "numbers" initially, but are not called "numbers" now, I suppose, but any definition that applies is just a hack to justify choices at the boundaries, I think.</p> <p>As mentioned, I haven't seen quaternions called "numbers."

Every runner has a result "ordinal" and any non-empty subset of the runners has a "winner."</p> <p>Cardinal numbers are like a pile of beans, and determining whether two piles of beans have the same amount in them.</p> <p>Ordinals are by far the most weird, because even addition of ordinals is non-commutative. </p> <p>In this case, then, ordinals and cardinals are "measurements" of something.</p> <p><strong>Non-standard real number definitions</strong></p> <p>There are also lots of variations of the real numbers that we call "numbers," basically because they are a variant of the real numbers.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: Exclusions</strong></p> <p>The hardest part of coming up with a definition for "number" is to exclude: Why don't we call matrices, or functions, or other similar things "numbers?" Things we see as primarily functions are not seen as "numbers," but it is hard to exclude them with anything rigorous. Indeed, one way to see the complex numbers is as a sub-ring of the ring of real <span class="math-container" id="8402408" visual_id="4582"><math alttext="2\times 2" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></semantics></math></span> matrices, and one reason we need complex numbers is that they are great at representing the operation of rotation - that is why we see them come in studying real matrices.</p> <p>Zero-divisors are often a sign that a thing isn't a number, but we do have <span class="math-container" id="8402409" visual_id="627"><math alttext="g" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>g</mi></semantics></math></span>-adic numbers with <span class="math-container" id="8402410" visual_id="627"><math alttext="g" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>g</mi></semantics></math></span> not prime, which is a ring with zero divisors.

Not in my experience.</p> <p>I also haven't seen finite field elements referred to as "numbers."</p> <p>So, no, the entire history of mathematics has not ascribed a single logical meaning to the word "number," so that we can distinguish what is and isn't a number. As noted in comments, "Cayley numbers" is another name for the octonions, but there are zero occurrences in <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Cayley%20numbers%2CCayley%20number&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CCayley%20numbers%3B%2Cc0">Google NGram of the singular phrase</a>, "Cayley number." So octonions are numbers, but a single octonion is not a "number?" That's just the world we live in. Number, being the most basic idea in mathematics, gets generalized in a lot of interesting ways, not all consistent, and not the same way over time.</p> <p>Recall, the ancients didn't define <span class="math-container" id="8402414" visual_id="92"><math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>0</mn></semantics></math></span> as a "number." </p> <blockquote> <p>Q: How many beans do you have? </p> <p>A: I don't have beans.</p> </blockquote> <p>(I suspect this failure was due to the confusion between cardinals and ordinals - we count finite cardinals by arbitrarily sorting and then computing the ordinal of the last element, but that fails when counting an empty collection...)</p>

Instead, they began "calculating" with geometric objects such as line segments (since this was more general than "numbers" (i.e. <span class="math-container" id="8402427" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>‚Ñö</mi></semantics></math></span>)).

Not in my experience.' You've obviously never met a programmer, then. :) For example, most programmers would call a C `uint32_t` value a number, even though it's an element of Z/nZ with modulus ^32.

You're saying the set of C unsigned ints together with the C unsigned int operators are numbers, because if you complete them with the rest of the set and replace the operations with different ones you get a field?
