So I'm looking for some suggestions.</p> <p>I want a challenge, some mathematics that I can attempt to learn/master. Obviously nothing impossible, but mathematics is my number <span class="math-container" id="18837254" visual_id="342"><math alttext="1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>1</mn></semantics></math></span> favorite thing and I really want something to keep me busy and something that can further my understanding of mathematics. Also I would be interested in any mathematical focused book suggestions.</p> <p>So far in school I've done the usual:</p> <p>Matrices, transformation matrices, Sine Cosine and Tangent (graphs and proofs), lots and lots of parabolas/quadratics, statistics, growth and decay, calculus intro, Calculus derivation and integration, vectors, proof by induction and complex numbers.</p> <p>Any suggestions would be heavily appreciated.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="4178363"> Welcome to the site @Jack. If you want to keep busy yourself, try to answer the questions on this site. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178364"> Some elementary number theory is in order I think! Or maybe computer science? Davenport, Strayer, Hardy and Wright are all good choices. Strayer is probably the most approachable, but my favourite is Davenport, and Hardy and Wright is sort of a classic. H and W covers a LOT of material. Check them out online before you choose which one you'd like to work with. There are also a ton of amazing resources on artofproblemsolving. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178365"> Are you familiar with any programming languages?? Mathematica, R? etc.. Those will be useful if you plan on continuing an education in mathematics/statistics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178371"> For me solving exercise is one of the best ways to learn mathematics and there  are lot of good exercises(and many other things) on [art of problem solving](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com).Before starting any course related with 'proving stuff' you may have a look at these [notes](https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178374"> I don't have any experience with programming or computer science, i'm more interested in pure mathematics but i'd be willing to check it out! Any recommendations? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178377"> If you are into "Proving stuff" I suggest taking a look at "topology" it's not easy (so it'll surely be a challenge) but it's a very nice topic. You can find an introductory course at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/  Btw: at the MIT open course ware you can find all kind of courses: https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm  Before diving into topology it might be good to first look at metric spaces </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178378"> With that said @ChrisDugale offers a good start in his comment </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178381"> Actually, HolyMonk offers a very good option. Point Set Topology is something that is often left out of even the university curriculum, yet it eventually becomes important to have a good knowledge of it. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4178389"> Hello Mr. Jack, welcome to the site. I would also recommend (aside reading/solving) to spend an hour each day on this site. It could open your eyes on problems you never knew of their existance :) . </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4180266"> Oh man, I'm psyched to answer this!  Let me share what I probably shouldn't be doing for about 9 hours of the day... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4180421"> To those voting to close this question, my defense is that 1) its a good question and has attracted good answers and 2) while true it may be asking for personal advice, I think it fits perfectly with the self-learning tag. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4180724"> Do you have an opinion as to whether you want to explore more abstract mathematics or more practical mathematics?  Signal processing is full of endless mathematical content, but much of the joy of those equations comes from the fact that we have practical uses for them everywhere.  Cryptography has a great quantity of "pure mathematics," but it's all tremendously specialized to cases that have use in cryptography. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4180734"> @SimpleArt: Questions on this site should be objectively answerable, or at least [good subjective](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/).  See also [What types of questions should I avoid asking?](http://math.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask): _"Avoid questions where every answer is equally valid"_ </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4181973"> Unfortunate the question has been closed. Seek to understand! Every single result you have learned to apply, now seek to understand that result from the ground up. Differential and integral calculus. Matrices and linear algebra. Trigonometry. Complex numbers. Intelligently asking (yourself then if necessary others) well-directed questions is key. There is a community room here. Also ##math on IRC Freenode! You can train yourself up to graduate level just from these resources + Wikipedia. Go for it! Don't wait for the educational system -- forge your own path. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4183185"> @BlueRaja-DannyPflughoeft I don't think every answer is equally valid. It's true that there is no *definitive* answer to this question, but certainly some of the suggestions are better suited than others to the mathematical training described by OP. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4183333"> @P-i- feel free to post that as an answer now ;) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4184187"> It is difficult to put into words how much this question warms my heart. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4185372"> Also take a look at this other question: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/45603/favorite-math-competition-problems </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4185374"> At that grade I remember keeping myself busy with a missle interception problem where you have to find the angle(α) to fire your projectile at speed Vp at a missle traveling at speed Vm which minimizes the time to impact using derivatives. Solve for dt/dα . </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5618997"> Ask around for Math Olympiad teams, they will not only provide you with interesting problems, but also friends who also have math as number 1. </td></tr>

<p>I was at a similar level of experience when I reached U.S. 12th grade.  (I'm not sure what "Year 12" refers to.)</p> <p>What I eventually found was that within the branches of math you have mentioned, <strong>you have had virtually zero experience with <em>discrete</em> mathematics.</strong></p> <p>The mathematics you have done deal with numbers that are infinitely divisible (real numbers), which is appropriate for dealing with physics quantities such as distance, speed, force, mass, acceleration, etc.  These mathematics are all <em>continuous mathematics.</em></p> <p>However, there is an entirely <em>different</em> sort of mathematics, which deals with <em>separate</em> quantities—such as "true" or "false."  "Spades" or "Clubs" or "Diamonds."  There is nothing in between.</p> <p>At first glance it would seem there is little of interest in studying only integers—after all, they are a subset of the real numbers—but that is the subject called <em>Number Theory</em> and it is the foundation for all modern cryptography!</p> <p>Other branches of discrete mathematics include Combinatorics (counting), and Graph Theory.</p> <p>I highly recommend the materials from MIT Open CourseWare.  The particular course I started with was <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Mathematics for Computer Science."</a></p> <p>For a bright high school student with the math you've studied under your belt, you should have no major trouble with the material—but plenty of interesting new ideas.</p> <p>Happy learning.  :)</p>

<tr><td comment_id="4190132"> *Year 12* is the final year of school in Australia (and maybe other countries too?), analogous to 12th grade in the U.S.  (although possibly with a little more calculus and linear algebra than in the U.S., depending on where in the U.S. you go to school; calculus begins in 11th grade/year 11, and carries on through 12th grade/year 12). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4190210"> @tracing, thanks for clarifying! </td></tr>
