<p>From what I have been told, everything in mathematics has a definition and everything is based on the rules of logic. For example, whether or not <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/11155/171192"><span class="math-container" id="13464782" visual_id="95278"><math alttext="0^{0}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> is <span class="math-container" id="13464783" visual_id="342"><math alttext="1" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>1</mn></semantics></math></span> is a simple matter of definition</a>.</p> <p><strong>My question is what the definition of a set is?</strong> </p> <p>I have noticed that many other definitions start with a set and then something. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29#Definition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">group is a set</a> with an operation, an equivalence relation is a set, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29#Definition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function can be considered a set</a>, even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Constructions_based_on_set_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">natural numbers can be defined as sets</a> of other sets containing the empty set.</p> <p>I understand that there is a whole area of mathematics (and philosophy?) that deals with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#Axiomatic_set_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set theory</a>. I have looked at a book about this and I understand next to nothing.</p> <p>From what little I can get, it seems a sets are "anything" that satisfies the axioms of set theory. It isn't enough to just say that a set is any collection of elements because of various paradoxes. <strong>So is it, for example, a right definition to say that a set is anything that satisfies the ZFC list of axioms?</strong></p>

Some highlights: There is a set with no members. There is a set with infinitely many members (skipping details on this one). Two sets are equal if they have the same members. The union of a family of sets exists. Etc. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2961379"> But it is not true that everything in math has a definition ... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2961589"> Every term in mathematics can not be defined.because, to define one term in mathematics or logic ,we need another term.so it is impossible to define everything.

Moreover, the Münchhausen trilemma, also called Agrippa's trilemma, purports that it is impossible to prove any certain  truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to OPs formulation in the bounty text this answer is aimed to give at least a glimpse of some aspects around the definition of set and set theories with focus on the axiom of choice. The top voted answers already contain the essential information.  </p> <p><strong>On the definition of sets:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>In modern times sets (and all other mathematical objects) are defined not in order to specify what they <em>are</em> but instead what we want to do with them. This led to different set theories which emerged essentially due to three different strands and common to all of them was the goal to develop a substantial mathematical theory.</p> <ul> <li><p>Set theory as a tool in understanding the <em>infinite</em> leading to the theory of cardinals and ordinals. We owe Georg Cantor the fundamentals of this theory who did it more or less single-handed and against all odds.</p></li> <li><p>Set theory as <em>foundation</em> of supplying the subject matter of mathematics. This claim reflects the mainstream and in many books we can find something like <em>set theory is the foundation of mathematics</em>.</p></li> <li><p>Set theory as supplier of a <em>common mode of reasoning</em> for diverse areas of mathematics. This is strongly related with the second strand and the <em>axiom of choice</em> is a famous set-theoretical principle of this type.</p></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>This reasoning from M. Potter's <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0199270414" rel="nofollow">Set Theory and It's Philosophy</a></em> is followed by </p> <blockquote> <p>The history of such theories is now a century old ... - and yet there is, even now, <em>no consensus</em> in the literature about the form they should take.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is no widely agreed <em>single</em> set theory which is favored by the mathematicians from which we could derive a <em>right</em> definition of a set. Instead depending on the area of research and the  richness of results within these areas <em>different set theories</em> like ZF, ZFC, etc. are taken as their basis.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Set theory today:</strong></p> <p>Presumably most of the daily work is explicitly or implicitely based upon <strong>ZF</strong>, <strong>ZFC</strong> or a somewhat weaker version in between. But we should be aware that each of these set theories has benefits as well as drawbacks.</p> <blockquote> <p>U. Felgner writes in <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3540055916" rel="nofollow">Models of ZF-Set theory</a></em></p> <p>We believe that the <strong>ZF</strong>-axioms describe in a correct way our intuitive contemplations concerning the notion of sets. The axiom of choice (<strong>AC</strong>) is intuitively not so clear as the other <strong>ZF</strong>-axioms are, but we have learned to use it because it seems to be indispensible in proving mathematical theorems. On the other hand (<strong>AC</strong>) has <em>strange</em> consequences, such as <em>every set can be well-ordered</em> and we are unable to <em>imagine</em> a well-ordering of the set of real numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Besides the well-order theorem (WOT) there are many other equivalents to the AC which are then also to accept.</p> <p><strong>Historical aspects around AC:</strong></p> <p>Some mathematicians had difficulties deciding for or against this axiom e.g. van der Waerden:</p> <blockquote> <p>In 1930, van der Waerden published his <em>Modern Algebra</em>, detailing the exciting new applications of the axiom. The book was very influential, providing Zorn und Teichmüller with a proving ground for their versions of choice, but van der Waerden's Dutch colleagues persuaded him to abondon the axiom in the second edition of 1937. He did so, but the resulting limited version of abstract algebra brought such a strong protest from his fellow algebraists that he was moved to reinstate the axiom and all its consequences in the third edition of 1950. (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf" rel="nofollow">P. Maddy, 1988</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>H. Herrlich summarizes the historical development in his <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3540309896" rel="nofollow">Axiom of Choice</a></em></p> <blockquote> <p>After Gödel (1938) proved the relative consistency of the Axiom of Choice by constructing within a given model of <strong>ZF</strong> a model of <strong>ZFC</strong>, the proponents of <strong>AC</strong> gained ground. Most modern textbooks take <strong>AC</strong> for granted and the vast majority of methematicians use <strong>AC</strong> freely.</p> <p>However, after Cohen (1963) proved the relative consistency of the negation of <strong>AC</strong> and, moreover, provided a method, called <em>forcing</em>, for producing a plethora of models of <strong>ZF</strong> that have or fail to have a wide range of specified properties, a growing number of mathematicians started to investigate the <strong>ZF</strong> world by substituting <strong>AC</strong> by a variety of possible alternatives, sometimes just by weaking <strong>AC</strong> and sometimes by replacing <strong>AC</strong> by axioms that contradict it.</p> </blockquote> <p>And with respect to a <em>true</em> definition of sets he continues</p> <blockquote> <p>All this work demonstrates how useful or convenient such axioms as <strong>AC</strong> and its possible alternatives are. But the question of the truth of <strong>AC</strong> is not touched, and Hilbert's First Problem remains unanswered. It is conceivable, even likely, that it will never be solved, despite Hilbert's optimistic slogan expressed in his Paris lecture: <em>in mathematics there is no ignorabimus</em>.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p><strong>Pros and Cons of AC:</strong></p> <p>Herrlich's book is an interesting source of information around AC. He presents many equivalents of AC and some related concepts to AC. The main part are the chapters <em>Disasters without Choice</em> consisting of 11 sections organised by mathematical disciplines and the chapter <em>Disaster with Choice</em> consisting of 2 sections. To get a glimpse about such consequences I pick out two, three easy understandable examples:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>From Section 4: Disasters without Choice</strong></p> <p>Section 4.4: Disasters in Algebra I: Vector Spaces</p> <p>In <strong>ZFC</strong> every vector space is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a single cardinal number, its dimension. Each of the two fundamental results which together enable us to associate dimension with a given vector space fail badly in <strong>ZF</strong>.</p> <p>Disaster 4.42: The following can happen:</p> <ol> <li>Vector spaces may have no bases</li> <li>Vector spaces may have two bases with different cardinalities.</li> </ol> <p>Theorem 4.44: Equivalent are:</p> <ol> <li>Every vector space has a basis</li> <li>AC</li> </ol> <hr/> <p>Section 4.6: Disasters in Elementary Analysis: The Reals and Continuity</p> <p>Disaster 4.53: The following can happen</p> <ol> <li><span class="math-container" id="13464825" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> may fail to be Fréchet, i.e., not every accumulation point <span class="math-container" id="13464826" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> of a subset A may be reachable by a sequence <span class="math-container" id="13464827" visual_id="4141"><math alttext="(a_{n})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> in <span class="math-container" id="13464828" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span>.</li> </ol> <p>... (9 more to follow)</p> </blockquote> <p>Though the Axiom of Choice is responsible for many beautiful results, it is equally responsible for the existence of several dreadful monstrosities - unwelcome and unneeded.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>From Section 5: Disasters with Choice</strong></p> <p>Section 5.1: Disasters in Elementary Analysis: </p> <p>Definition 5.1: The equation <span class="math-container" id="13464829" visual_id="10751"><math alttext="f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> is called the <em>Cauchy-equation</em></p> <p>Consider a function <span class="math-container" id="13464830" visual_id="3106"><math alttext="f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>ℝ</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> that satisfies the Cauchy-equation for all real <span class="math-container" id="13464831" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="13464832" visual_id="68"><math alttext="y" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math></span>.

In fact I had two aspects in mind, when I was thinking about an answer. At first OP had pointed to ZFC as if it would be the solution to fix all problems. I wanted to show some pros and cons of AC so that OP could relativise this position. Furthermore a *right* definition of a set or better set theory has also to be analysed with respect to its capabilities describing infinities (ordinals, cardinals). It is curious that this fundamental property of sets is hardly addressed in the answers. </td></tr>
