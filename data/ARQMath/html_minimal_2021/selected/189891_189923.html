What is limiting your time? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="437878"> @Snowball: My work schedule is pretty busy and I am getting my CPA. Maybe I can accommodate more time, but it will be hard to invest too much into it. The purpose of my request is for an online/distance learning class I am enrolled in (algorithms) that has proofs in homework problems. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="437967"> Learning how to prove things is a skill you learn yourself through practice...there is no book that will make you create your own proofs of things. This is not just a "topic of maths" that can be learned in a few hours but the basis of all mathematical thought! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="438101"> This skill takes a little time to cultivate, but you should be able to make rapid progress if you are determined! You can probably get helpful feedback on your proof-work here, too. </td></tr>

                        <p>I'm kind of amazed that no one's pointed out the <a href="http://www.tricki.org/" rel="nofollow">tricki</a> yet. Also if you search for the type of question you're thinking of you should be able to find great examples of simple proof techniques (induction, telescopy, etc.) on this very site. And if you know the names of techniques I think google will be your friend: searching <a href="https://www.google.ca/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=explain+proof+by+induction&amp;oq=ex&amp;gs_l=hp.1.0.35i39l2j0l2.75.591.0.2276.2.2.0.0.0.0.158.291.0j2.2.0.cdymh..0.0...1.SLniHZy3YCs&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=28679e4043d5634f&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=839" rel="nofollow">explain proof by induction</a> turns up some useful results and nice examples.</p>
