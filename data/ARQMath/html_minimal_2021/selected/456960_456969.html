And I don't think that the "intuitive notion" of a limit is anything more than placing a black box around the limit concept and saying "Don't worry what this means at all; just see how it is used and try to copy that."

<p>Here is a personal story, and hopefully it will shine some light on some of the trends in recent math education.</p> <hr/> <p>I went to a small (US-based) high school that was primarily an agricultural high school. The year I took calculus, it was with a teacher in his last year before retirement. We learned <span class="math-container" id="4808912" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definitions of limits and derivatives <em>before</em> we learned the "exponent rule". However, we didn't really learn proof technique, nor did we learn the importance of definitions nor the preciseness of mathematical language. In fact, we were all quite glad to be done with the formalism by the time we learned that <span class="math-container" id="4808913" visual_id="165710"><math alttext="(x^{n})^{\prime}=nx^{n-1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>′</mo></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. This was in the late 90s.</p> <p>I then went to a highly-revered engineering school. Calculus classes, and indeed, introductory engineering classes, were all designed around Maple. While we had to learn Calculus, we primarily had to learn it using Maple. As a result, our homework and exams focused on how to apply techniques such as integration by parts in Maple. We had "gateway examinations" on computer that required us to answer questions in Maple-based syntax.</p> <p>I left my undergraduate program shortly before finishing, due to medical reasons. When I returned 4 years later and changed my major to Mathematics, I had to take real analysis. When we got to the formal definitions of derivatives and limits, the professor asked how many of us knew <span class="math-container" id="4808914" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> proofs. I was the only one.</p> <p>He then asked how many of us went through a Maple-based Calculus education. Again, I was the only one.</p> <hr/> <p>In a span of no more than eight years, a prominent Top Tier US university completely overhauled its calculus education not once, but twice.</p> <p>In both cases, the introductory level material left students woefully underprepared for doing any sort of rigorous math. The introduction of a required "Intro to Proofs" class did very little to skew the comprehension curve in the class.</p> <p>Truth be told, it was only after quite a long while of self-education that I began to understand analysis, algebra, and mathematics.</p> <p>Indeed, some may argue that undergraduate real analysis is just definition pushing. But my classmates couldn't even push definitions! We were hopelessly lost!</p> <hr/> <p>So, given that high-school students in Calculus are advanced at math, should we teach <span class="math-container" id="4808915" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> proofs? In my opinion, yes. But also, in my opinion, it should be done to teach what "proving" something means.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with "definition pushing" mathematics, especially at an early level. At the same time, we must still prepare the non-mathematician students for their careers in engineering, finance, or the sciences.</p> <hr/> <p>High school is supposed to prepare us for college. The best thing we can do for a college-bound high school student is to teach them how to think. Rigorous thinking applies to many fields.</p> <p>So if you can teach <span class="math-container" id="4808916" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> rigorously, but without losing sight of its imperative, then do so.</p> <p>Otherwise, find a different way. My educational experience set my mathematical understanding back 10 years, and I "learned" multiple ways. It took me 10 years to figure out what could have been taught to me in a single, well-structured calculus class.</p> <p>So, to answer your question, yes. The rigor is worth it. But it's only worth it if you can do it right.</p>
