<div id="question" question_id="366834">
<p>I just read this whole article: <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/SetTheory.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/SetTheory.pdf</a><br/> which is also discussed over here: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/356264/infinite-sets-dont-exist/">Infinite sets don't exist!?</a></p> <p>However, the paragraph which I found most interesting is not really discussed there. I think this paragraph illustrates where most (read: close to all) mathematicians fundementally disagree with Professor NJ Wildberger. I must admit that I'm a first year student mathematics, and I really don't know close to enough to take sides here. Could somebody explain me here why his arguments are/aren't correct?</p> <p><strong>These edits are made after the answer from Asaf Karagila.</strong><br/> <strong>Edit</strong> <span class="math-container" id="3910342" visual_id="286"><math alttext="\;" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi></mi></semantics></math></span> I've shortened the quote a bit, I hope this question can be reopened ! The full paragraph can be read at the link above.<br/> <strong>Edit</strong> <span class="math-container" id="3910343" visual_id="286"><math alttext="\;" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi></mi></semantics></math></span> I've listed the quotes from his article, I find most intresting:   </p> <ul> <li><em>The job [of a pure mathematician] is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live.</em></li> <li><em>To Euclid, an Axiom was a fact that was sufficiently obvious to not require a proof.</em></li> </ul> <p>And from a discussion with the author on the internet:</p> <p><em>You are sharing with us the common modern assumption that mathematics is built up from  "axioms". It is not a position that Newton, Euler or Gauss would have had a lot of sympathy with, in my opinion. In this course we will slowly come to appreciate that clear and careful definitions are a much preferable beginning to the study of mathematics.</em></p> <p>Which leads me to the following question: Is it true that with modern mathematics it is becoming less important for an axiom to be self-evident? It sounds to me that ancient mathematics was much more closely related to physics then it is today. Is this true ?</p> <blockquote> <h1>Does mathematics require axioms?</h1> <p>Mathematics does not require "Axioms". The job of a pure mathematician   is not to build some elaborate castle in the sky, and to proclaim that   it stands up on the strength of some arbitrarily chosen assumptions.   The job is to <em>investigate the mathematical reality of the world in   which we live</em>. For this, no assumptions are necessary. Careful   observation is necessary, clear definitions are necessary, and correct   use of language and logic are necessary. But at no point does one need   to start invoking the existence of objects or procedures that we   cannot see, specify, or implement.</p> <p>People use the term "Axiom" when   often they really mean <em>definition</em>. Thus the "axioms" of group theory   are in fact just definitions. We say exactly what we mean by a group,   that's all. There are no assumptions anywhere. At no point do we or   should we say, "Now that we have defined an abstract group, let's   assume they exist".</p> <p>Euclid may have called certain of his initial statements Axioms, but   he had something else in mind. Euclid had a lot of geometrical facts   which he wanted to organize as best as he could into a logical   framework. Many decisions had to be made as to a convenient order of   presentation. He rightfully decided that simpler and more basic facts   should appear before complicated and difficult ones. So he contrived   to organize things in a linear way, with most Propositions following   from previous ones by logical reasoning alone, with the exception of   <em>certain initial statements</em> that were taken to be self-evident. To   Euclid, <em>an Axiom was a fact that was sufficiently obvious to not   require a proof</em>. This is a quite different meaning to the use of the   term today. Those formalists who claim that they are following in   Euclid's illustrious footsteps by casting mathematics as a game played   with symbols which are not given meaning are misrepresenting the   situation.</p> <p>And yes, all right, the Continuum hypothesis doesn't really need to be   true or false, but is allowed to hover in some no-man's land, falling   one way or the other depending on <em>what you believe</em>. Cohen's proof of   the independence of the Continuum hypothesis from the "Axioms" should   have been the long overdue wake-up call. </p> <p>Whenever discussions about the foundations of mathematics arise, we   pay lip service to the "Axioms" of Zermelo-Fraenkel, but do we ever   use them? Hardly ever. With the notable exception of the "Axiom of   Choice", I bet that fewer than 5% of mathematicians have ever employed   even one of these "Axioms" explicitly in their published work. The   average mathematician probably can't even remember the "Axioms". I   think I am typical-in two weeks time I'll have retired them to their   usual spot in some distant ballpark of my memory, mostly beyond   recall.</p> <p>In practise, working mathematicians are quite aware of the lurking   contradictions with "infinite set theory". We have learnt to keep the   demons at bay, not by relying on "Axioms" but rather by developing   conventions and intuition that allow us to seemingly avoid the most   obvious traps. Whenever it smells like there may be an "infinite set"   around that is problematic, we quickly use the term "class". For   example: A topology is an "equivalence class of atlases". Of course   most of us could not spell out exactly what does and what does not   constitute a "class", and we learn to not bring up such questions in   company.</p> </blockquote>

The *category* of sets makes perfect sense, and so does the category of finite groups, and the category of groups. The nonexistence of a set of sets has nothing to do with it. The epistemological foundations of category theory were carefully laid. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786987"> *The job [of a pure mathematician] is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live.* Nonsense. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786994"> @Zev: The title question is legitimate, and the question in the body has been rephrased. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786996"> @ZevChonoles I changed it. I hope this topic doesn't get closed ! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787000"> If it is any comfort to you, there is no ned to take sides. Just do math. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787013"> @Kasper A word of caution: it would be counterproductive for you to try to understand mathematics by following what he says. It would probably be more fruitful to learn everything in the mainstream way, and then find places where he touches on a topic you are familiar with. *Starting* with what he is saying here is a surefire recipe for confusion. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787018"> While there may not be much more to say after Asafâ€™s answer, I have on principle voted to reopen the question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787026"> @BrianM.Scott I am not sure it is a sign that the question about some text should be open when a definitive answer starts with "TL;DR" </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787029"> @Michael: I take the question to be primarily the one in the title, the quotation serving mostly to provide context. And one can usefully address the question in the title without having read the context. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787037"> @Michael: It's not that I didn't read it at all. I glanced and read a bit from the quote. I edited that first line. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787043"> @Brian: I've always been skeptical of the effectiveness of pretending someone asks what you want them to have asked rather than what they did ask. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787048"> Kasper, you took away the reference to computer science, which renders the second point of my answer to be out of context. Please take into consideration existing answers when editing a question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787052"> Wildberger is a finitist, I believe, and thus takes a very unorthodox view versus most mathematicians. But this is why he references the "real world", and why Asaf brought up computer science (where there tend to be more finitists). To finitists, there are no infinite objects accessible in totality, which renders most mathematics problematic. But again, this is highly against the mainstream. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787056"> @Hurkyl: I fail to see the relevance of your comment. The question in the title is perfectly clear. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787057"> @trb456: I brought up computer science because it was mentioned in the original version of the question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787101"> Is the question supposed to be "Does mathematics need axioms?" or "Does mathematics need axioms that conform to reality?". The answers below seem to be mixed between these two questions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787106"> [Do we need axioms?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E781QE7ZQK8) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787108"> Before this question gets into a second volley of reopen votes, can someone please open a meta thread about this? I hate closure wars. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787116"> @AsafKaragila True. I didn't know there was a close/reopen thing before. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787129"> @PeterTamaroff So you vote to close the question, while not even reading the question up to the third paragraph ?? I clearly write: *I've shortened the quote a bit, I hope this question can be reopened !* </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787136"> @Kasper I have read the whole question. What makes you think I didn't? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787161"> @PeterTamaroff You said that you didn't know about the closing/reopen thing before. But as I write: "*I hope this question can be reopened*" this clearly implies that question was closed. But never mind. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787166"> @Kasper Well, I clearly missed that one. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787171"> @Peter, Kasper: All those "clearly" are exactly the points I made in my answer where we skip rigor and make mistakes! (The proof that I am right is left as an exercise to the reader) :-) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789246"> "The job is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live." That sounds more like a mathematical physicist than a mathematician. Pure mathematics is, by definition, *divorced* from "practical" concerns. And that's a good thing, too. Why? Well, for one, there are many cases where a mathematical object was investigated for its own sake, independent of any connections to physical reality, and then found to have applications to physical reality! From a practical point of view, restricting math to "physical reality" would entail restricting to _what we know_ (cont'd) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789250"> (cont'd) about physical reality. And that would limit the amount of mathematical objects and results we'd have at our disposal when our knowledge increases. I'd imagine it'd slow down progress. Not good. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789263"> Oh yeah, and about "finitism" -- I think I should put here that if physicists ever discover the universe is in fact infinite (which is possible), then thanks to "infinitist" maths, we can be assured we'll be able to treat it correctly in whatever theories will be needed. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789275"> And even if it's not, the results obtained from mathematical models based on *abstract* infinite objects still prove to be very useful. Calculus requires a complete continuum to work, and even if real space is not a continuum after all, I don't think engineers would stop using calculus to build buildings. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789302"> I want to point out also that there's nothing wrong with _doing_ finitist math, but when you start claiming the other kind is all nonsense, then there's a problem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="797527"> @mike4ty4: Dear Mike, The author of the essay in question talks (in positive terms) about the Lie group <span class="math-container" id="3910360" visual_id="4914"><math alttext="G_{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></semantics></math></span>.  I doubt that he's unaware of the value and interest of pure mathematics, or of the difference between pure mathematics and physics or engineering.  I think it's possible to understand his essay in a slightly more nuanced manner than the one you are adopting.  Regards, </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="806935"> @Matt E: What would that slightly more nuanced manner be? Because it seems one of his objections to infinite sets/objects is that they cannot be "realized" in the "universe" (the real, physical universe). In other words, he seems to be implying that maths should be _restricted_ by physics and physical limits. If I'm wrong, _how am I wrong_, and _how else_ can it be interpreted? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="807136"> @Matt E: Also, is it possible to have an "axiomless" mathematics that also doesn't have physics-based limitations added in? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="813176"> Math doesnt have to be restricted, but the math that the universe follows is restricted, there is no "Leprechauns" or "infinite sets" in the real world, even though some claim that they can "imagine" it, or claim these concept makes sense (actually they are just meanigless symbols on a piece of paper). So you can divide math into two groups, meaningless useless philsophical math, and the real true theorems of the universe. </td></tr>

<p>It seems that many people regard the author's view as naive or un(der)informed.  I disagree.  </p> <p>There is a well-known phrase attributed to Kronecker (presumably originally stated in German, and perhaps I am slightly misquoting the English translation as well) that "God created the natural numbers, and all else is the work of man".  This is (in my view) an essentially anti-axiomatic declaration, which aligns fairly closely with the point of view in the essay under consideration, namely that mathematics is the investigation of certain "god-given" objects, such as the natural numbers, or the Lie group <span class="math-container" id="3910359" visual_id="4914"><math alttext="G_{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></semantics></math></span> (to take an example from the essay).</p> <p>This view is partly Platonist (in the sense that that term is generally used in these sorts of discussions, referring to a belief in a non-formal mathematical reality) and partly constructivist.  It is one that I'm personally sympathetic to, and I don't think I'm alone in that.  I regard ZFC as a convenient framework for doing mathematics in, but not as the actual basis underlying the mathematics I do; the natural numbers and the investigation of their properties are (in my view) much more fundamental than ZFC or other axiomatic systems that might encode them --- and the same goes for <span class="math-container" id="3910360" visual_id="4914"><math alttext="G_{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></semantics></math></span> (again in my view)!</p> <p>My view might be a minority one among working mathematicians (I don't really know), but I know that I'm not the only one who holds it.  I also know others who genuinely believe that everything they do rests on ZFC, and that this is of crucial importance.  </p> <hr/> <p>Another thing: it is often said that even though many mathematicians don't explicitly invoke the axioms of ZFC in their work, they are implicitly resting on those foundations.  Personally, I don't find this convincing; I think it is often the case that those who <em>do</em> believe that everything necessarily rests on ZFC find it easy to construe what others are doing as (implicitly) resting on those foundations.  But those who don't believe this also won't accept the claims that their work implicitly relies on those foundations.</p> <hr/> <p>Just to be clear, by the way: my comments here are not meant to apply to things like theorems in group theory, or commutative algebra, or Lie theory, where one derives consequences from the axioms that a structure satisfies (although they might apply in certain contexts where set-theoretic issues potentially intervene); obviously there axioms play a role, although, as the author writes, in these contexts axioms might be better construed as definitions. Rather, they apply to the basic objects of mathematics like the natural numbers, Diophantine equations, and so on.</p> <hr/> <p>It also seems worth mentioning something here which I also made a comment about on another answer:</p> <p>It doesn't seem to currently be known whether FLT is proved in PA, or only in some more sophisticated axiomization of the natural numbers.  On the other hand, there is no doubt among number theorists that the proof is correct.  How is such a situation possible?  In my view, it's because people ultimately verify the proof not by checking that it is consistent with some specified list of axioms, but by checking that it accords with their basic intuition of the situation, an intiuition which exists prior to any axiomization.  </p> <p>In the end, it will presumably be possible to isolate precisely those properties of the natural numbers that are used in the proof, whether it is the axioms of PA or something stronger, but my point is that the proof is known to be correct although what precise properties of <span class="math-container" id="3910361" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>â„•</mi></semantics></math></span> are being used is not yet known!  This is because we can argue about <span class="math-container" id="3910362" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>â„•</mi></semantics></math></span> based on our intrinsic understanding of it, without having to encode all the aspects of that understanding that we use in precise axiomatic form.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="797666"> Dear Matt, while I somewhat agree with your assessment about FLT, it seems to me that the fact number theorists often think intuitively is what makes some number theoretical theorems very difficult to prove. It's not that set theory or group theory, or whatever is harder or easier than number theory. It's different because you have an axiomatic framework which guides your intuition more than you have a natural grasp on what are the objects you manipulate. We all understand the natural number, but as the difficulties in proving FLT (and other statements) show -- [cont'd] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="797670"> [...] we don't really have a full grasp of the natural numbers, or else these things would be easier to do Much like how we can prove that the collection of topologies on the real numbers form a set using the axioms of ZF once we have a tight grasp on those axioms. To sum my point, I agree that natural numbers are much more "natural" to our mind and we can understand them, or think that we do, without referring to an axiomatic framework. But the fact that we can't really prove things which are very simple to formulate means that we really don't have a full mathematical grasp after all. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="797828"> @AsafKaragila: Dear Asaf, I agree that in some sense we certainly don't have a full grasp, since there are difficult theorems and open conjectures about them. But on the other hand, I think we all have some version of a mental image of a trail of stones, one after the other, receding off to the horizon, which informs our picture of <span class="math-container" id="3910366" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>â„•</mi></semantics></math></span>.

Regarding FLT, I'd be pretty surprised if in the end the proof didn't work in PA, because I just don't see what ... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="797833"> ... ingredient is involved in the argument that has the infinitary or self-referential nature that normally seems to be involved in statements that can't be proved in PA.  But in practice the point (to me) seems to be that number theorists really argue with the standard model of <span class="math-container" id="3910366" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>â„•</mi></semantics></math></span>, and apply inductive arguments to subsets of the standard model in a framework of naive set theory in which <span class="math-container" id="3910366" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>â„•</mi></semantics></math></span> is characterized as the least infinite ordinal (or something like that).

(And officially of course this is happening with the stanard model in some model of ZFC, but in practice I believe its happening with the naive image of the standard model that's inside all of our heads.)  Anyway, thanks for the thoughtful response! Cheers, </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1374541"> Dear Matt, I ran into this thread again, and I've decided to read the answers once more. I strongly disagree with your first line. Either the writer fails to grasp the fine points in set theory (i.e. under informed) or he is lying on purpose for demagogic reasons of creating a sense that set theorists are just idiots pretending to do mathematics. For example he says about the Continuum Hypothesis that if we cannot decide if there is something between our first and second infinity then it's time to admit that set theory is not math. But the continuum is not "the second infinity", [...] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1374547"> [...] the second infinity is <span class="math-container" id="3910367" visual_id="89021"><math alttext="\aleph_{1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">â„µ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math></span>. He suggests that the axiom of infinity is equivalent to asserting the existence of an unstoppable mouse (amusingly there is a concept called "mouse" in set theory, and there is an "iterable mouse" which we can iterate some operation on the mouse without end, so in some sense... there is an axiom "there is an unstoppable mouse"). The axiom of infinity has a very precise formulation, and it has an informal name. Perhaps it is time to start calling the axioms "Axiom 1,2,3,4,..." and then no one will claim anything is wrong with the names. [...] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1374550"> [...] And so, maybe the writer do know a bit of set theory. But maybe not. Some time ago he appeared on this site, and posted a semi-promotional link to his YouTube channel under the guise of the claim that no one can explicitly state a Dedekind cut which is <span class="math-container" id="3910368" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>Ï€</mi></semantics></math></span>. Clearly a false statement, one can *easily* do that. Since I'm willing to believe that mathematicians are generally not deceitful (although I'm sure I'm being purposefully naive here), this leaves the only option. The writer is uninformed and lacks basic understanding in set theory, which he criticizes. Regards, </td></tr>
