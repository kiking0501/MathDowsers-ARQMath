<p>I'm currently in an engineering program, so most of my mathematical education has been applied in nature (multivariable calculus, ODEs, PDEs, probability). The only real "theory"-based courses I've taken have been abstract algebra<span class="math-container" id="16107480" visual_id="26061"><math alttext="{}^{1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi></mi><mn>1</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> and a proof-based differential equations class.</p> <p>I'm looking to expand my mathematical horizons before graduate school, and I figured the two places that might be interesting for me (as well as useful!) are real analysis and differential geometry. I don't really have the space in my course schedule to take either of these, and the former is listed as a prerequisite for the latter at my university.</p> <p>I know that Rudin's <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em> is the crème de la crème for real analysis texts, but I've started reading a pdf of it and it's not only extremely dense (which I'm not quite used to), but I also don't think I have the mathematical maturity to grasp it.</p> <p>I was wondering if anyone knows of any good texts where I can learn real analysis without presupposing a great deal of mathematical maturity. My foundations in calculus are quite strong, but my knowledge is that real analysis is only tangentially related. As a side question, I also want to ask if real analysis is <em>really</em> a prerequisite for differential geometry (I'm skeptical).</p> <p><span class="math-container" id="16107481" visual_id="26061"><math alttext="{}^{1}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi></mi><mn>1</mn></msup></semantics></math></span>We covered what you would normally find in an undergraduate algebra class and also touched on a bit of Galois theory, but to be completely honest I wasn't all that comfortable with the few Galois theory lectures we had, anyway.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="3558968"> Why the downvote? I was going to post on the meta if this type of question was allowed, but there's even a tag called book recommendations here... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3558984"> For someone with Engineering background, you probably would not benefit from Real Analysis. I suggest you consider Applied Mathematics, Numerical Methods, and such. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3558991"> Perhaps, but the primary purpose is to satiate my mathematical curiosity, and only the secondary purpose is to be "useful." There are graduate classes I'm taking that deal with applied mathematics and numerical methods relevant to my specific subfield of engineering, so while real analysis might be a "waste of time" for me, I'm hoping it's an "enjoyable waste of time." </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3558996"> A few other books that might be more readable than Rudin are Calculus by Spivak, Fundamental Ideas of Analysis by Reed, and Understanding Analysis by Abbot.  There are a lot of other popular Real Analysis textbooks too. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559011"> I would strongly recommend Mathematical Analysis by Apostol. It is a comprehensive text of real analysis and it's significantly more readable than Rudin. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559039"> If you can't read Rudin you have zero chance of reading a text in differential geometry. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559042"> Real analysis _really is_ a prerequisite for differential geometry. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559091"> Real analysis is not necessarily useless for engineering, it depends on what field the OP will pursue in graduate school. Signal processing, for example, is a branch of EE where real analysis is helpful. Iindeed, it is not uncommon for PhD advisors to require students to take a course or two, at least covering Lebesgue integration and measure theory. Most research papers in signal processing assume this background and would be unreadable without it. However, it will be an uphill battle to learn this material via self-study. My advice would be to make room in your schedule to take the courses. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559312"> @Bungo : I did learn this via self-study :) thanks to internet, it is now very possible to learn all the mathematics and science in general only via self-studies. hence my advice, if you are "talented enough" then don't be afraid to download a few pdf or books on the subject, go to wikipedia and the forums, and see if you understand something (before going to a class) and if you have difficulties to understand those books, to be afraid to blame the author "who isn't talented at all for teaching" </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559333"> There's also Korner's A companion to analysis. I've heard it's good, and it has a nice explanation at the start about why we do analysis over <span class="math-container" id="16107482" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> rather than <span class="math-container" id="16107483" visual_id="856"><math alttext="\mathbb{Q}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℚ</mi></semantics></math></span>, which I'm sure spivak mentions later too. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="3559854"> Given your background, I think you do have the mathematical maturity to study Rudin's PMA. It's  a matter of how much effort you want to spend on it, especially on the exercises. The first three chapters can be time consuming, after which you should proceed rather smoothly. Studying an easier introduction and then PMA does not necessarily cost you less time. So my suggestion is to either dive into PMA, or read a different book and forget about PMA. </td></tr>

<div class="answer">
<div answer_id="1744217" id="answer">
<p>Given what you've said, for real analysis I recommend looking at these three:</p> <p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/052138835X" rel="nofollow"><strong>Yet Another Introduction to Analysis</strong></a> by Victor Bryant</p> <blockquote> <p>Bryant's book is excellent for reading without an instructor. All the exercises have solutions. The book is full of pictures, diagrams, and other pedagogical aids. The book is excellent as a direct sequel to the standard calculus sequence and it is carefully written with this in mind.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0882751794" rel="nofollow"><strong>Advanced Real Calculus</strong></a> by Kenneth S. Miller</p> <blockquote> <p>Miller's book is notable for its no-nonsense straightforward and uncluttered style. Miller, also the author of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IA238E" rel="nofollow"><strong>Engineering Mathematics</strong></a> (which was later reprinted by Dover publications), got his B.S. in chemical engineering before going on to get M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in math. Because of his background (Miller also taught engineers for many years and has worked in both government and industry as an applied mathematician), Miller's book is definitely worth considering. As a mathematician he's not a "Rudin", but for what's it's worth he did do a post-doc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0070602212" rel="nofollow"><strong>Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Real Variables</strong></a> by Murray R. Spiegel</p> <blockquote> <p>Although Spiegel's book gets into Lebesgue integration (but only for the reals), much of it should be accessible to you, especially for supplementary reading and for the worked problems. Spiegel, who you may recognize because you are an engineering student, is the author of a lot of Schaum's Outline books on engineering math topics (complex variables, Laplace transform, vector analysis, theoretical mechanics, difference equations, etc.), and his real variables book reflects this by including a chapter on Fourier series.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't think differential geometry is a good choice for "expanding your horizons", but if you really want to do this, I think <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132641437" rel="nofollow"><strong>Elements of Differential Geometry</strong></a> by Richard S. Millman and George D. Parker would be a far better choice than Manfredo do Carmo's <strong>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</strong> that someone else mentioned. FYI, I've taken a course that used do Carmo's book and I've audited a course that used Millman/Parker's book.</p> <p>As for abstract mathematics, you might want to look at Paul Roman's 2-volume work <strong>Some Modern Mathematics for Physicists and Other Outsiders</strong> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780080180977" rel="nofollow">Volume 1 contents</a>. Despite the wide selection of advanced topics covered, these books do a nice job of making things accessible to someone not steeped in Bourbaki style mathematics.</p> <p><em>(ADDED 4 DAYS LATER)</em> The morning after I wrote the comments above, I looked at my copy of <strong>Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Real Variables</strong> and realized I made a mistake in recommending it. I thought most of the book was pre-Lebesgue integration topics, with Lebesgue integration only introduced in the later parts of the book. In fact, the book begins with Lebesgue measure and integration, and thus it would not be appropriate for someone who has not studied undergraduate real analysis or advanced calculus. Aside from the mismatch with your needs, the book is fine.</p> <p>As it was the weekend, and I was sick and couldn't do much else anyway, I decided to carefully look through the real analysis books I have (over 100 texts at the mid undergraduate level, advanced undergraduate level, and beginning graduate level) and see what I could find that might be worth suggesting besides those I've mentioned.</p> <p>In doing this, I only considered relatively short texts that could be covered in one semester, because when self-studying lengthy texts it is very easy to get overwhelmed and then procrastinate and not accomplish much. For the most part, I also only considered texts that were not especially abstract or formal, so for example if metric spaces appeared at all, they played a very minor role overall, and formalities such as axiomatic set theory and Peano axioms did not intrude into the introductory material. Finally, I looked for books that seemed to have topics or emphasis that might be useful to engineering, such as Fourier series.</p> <p>I found two additional books that best fit these conditions, one by Labarre and one by Randol. My personal favorite for what I believe would best work for you is Randol's book, and this includes those books I have already mentioned.</p> <p>Because it is difficult to find anything specific about older texts on the internet (no one seems to go to the trouble), I've written some comments about each book. I've also included some more information about Kenneth S. Miller's book, for the same reason.</p> <p>Anthony Edward Labarre, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0486462978" rel="nofollow"><strong>Intermediate Mathematical Analysis</strong></a>, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968, xvi + 253 pages.</p> <blockquote> <p>Very nice treatment with a more than average coverage (for one semester length books) of topics -- complete ordered fields, cardinal numbers, equivalence of sequential and neighborhood limit notions, structure of open sets in the reals, uniform continuity, derivatives have the Darboux property, contraction mappings, the measure zero characterization of Riemann integrability, uniform convergence of sequences of functions, Picard's theorem on the existence of a unique solution to <span class="math-container" id="16107485" visual_id="71758"><math alttext="\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="16107486" visual_id="15034"><math alttext="y(x_{0})=y_{0}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></semantics></math></span> where <span class="math-container" id="16107487" visual_id="1"><math alttext="f" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>f</mi></semantics></math></span> is continuous and Lipschitz with respect to <span class="math-container" id="16107488" visual_id="68"><math alttext="y" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math></span> in some rectangle containing <span class="math-container" id="16107489" visual_id="9185"><math alttext="(x_{0},y_{0})" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></span> in its interior [proved using contraction mappings], final chapter (pp. 202-237) on Fourier series that includes discussions of the Dirichlet Problem and Fejér's Theorem. <strong>Main Weakness:</strong> There is very little material on the convergence and divergence of infinite series of real numbers, and there is almost no material on power series.</p> </blockquote> <p>Burton Swank Randol, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0155458515" rel="nofollow"><strong>An Introduction to Real Analysis</strong></a>, Harbrace College Mathematics Series, Harcourt, Brace and World, 1969, xii + 112 pages.</p> <blockquote> <p>Randol's book seems to be primarily focused on the convergence and divergence of series of functions.
