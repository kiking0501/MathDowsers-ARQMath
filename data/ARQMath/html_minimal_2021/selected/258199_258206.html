                        <p>I am a maths student in my second year of university. I have taken and done quite well in Calculus I, II, III as well as a linear algebra (application focused) class. I have not worked much with proofs. My school's course catalog lists Abstract Algebra as one of the next courses but suggests a remedial "introduction to mathematical proofs" class for some. My question is if the community thinks it would be doable to go ahead with Abstract.</p>  <p>Our Abstract Algebra class is at the level of Thomas Hungerfords "Abstract Algebra: An Introduction". </p>

Those are hardly "remedial," that is, you don't take them because you're doing poorly. Many schools actually consider a course of this type a prerequisite to many of their advanced courses. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="565056"> @anonymous You are right it is a sort of prerequisite and definitely not for failing students. I would like to study through the material, any good introductory proof books/resources in mind? amWhy had a good book suggestion, I am interested in getting some more of similar resources. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="565276"> amWhy made the suggestion I wanted to make, so I don't have much to say beyond his answer. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1905535"> I think you need a course in "Foundation of Mathematics". </td></tr>

                        <p>If you have the interest, and are willing to work hard, go for it! <br><br>I first encountered proofs in linear algebra, and then in abstract algebra; it's a good domain of study for learning how to write proofs. I'd suggest you "skim" Hungerfords text in advance of the class to "preview" and become acquainted his style of writing and his manner of writing proofs..</p>  <p>At the same time you're previewing the course text, it might be wise to get a hold of the book:<br> <strong><em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521675995">How to Prove It: A Structured Approach</a></em></strong> by Daniel Velleman. I think you'd find it helpful to read and work through this book, at least in part, before taking the class. And in any case, it will serve as a good reference while taking the class, for help to better understand proofs and write them well. </p>  <p><em>How to Prove It...</em> expands on each of the following topics:</p>  <p>*) The sentential (propositional) and predicate logic; quantificational logic<br> *) Set theory<br> *) Relations and functions<br> *) Mathematical induction and recursion<br> *) Infinite sets<br> *) Proof-writing<br></p>  <p>If you click on the link to the book, you can "preview" the book, and see the table of contents.</p>  <p>Other possible resources, both of which are highly regarded:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/069111966X"><em>How to Solve It</em></a>, author G. Polya.</li> <li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0273728911"><em>Thinking Mathematically</em></a>, authors J. Mason, L. Burton, K. Stacey.</li> </ul>
