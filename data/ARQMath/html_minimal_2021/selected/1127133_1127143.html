<p>So I was thinking about a hard euclidean geometry problem, when it hit me just how much more difficult it would become without the aid of a diagram. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow find corresponding diagrams for something like number theory? It doesn't have to be euclidean geometry diagrams like the Greeks did with Algebra (which actually made it harder than without diagrams, as we all know), but instead we need to find a natural diagrammatical representation. Something like Ferrers diagram seems to be a tiny step in that direction, and I can imagine similar things being done for all of number theory.</p> <p>Is this idea at all feasible? Please explain why.</p> <p>EDIT: I will leave the above to make answers more interesting. However, a related question (as suggested by Omnomnomnom) that is perhaps more useful is the following: What kinds of diagrams already exist in number theory?</p> <p>Eagerly awaiting any responses!</p>

<tr><td comment_id="2300387"> One large area of Number Theory is [Geometry of Numbers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_numbers) We have provided only one link, but if you search you will get many hits.  And there is geometric intuition behind quite a few proofs, particularly estimates. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300392"> @Omnomnomnom: Hello, thanks for your reply. However, that is not what I meant. Just imagine how we don't have one giant diagram for all of geometry, and you will see what I mean about number theory. I apologize if it isn't explained too well. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300400"> I apologize if I didn't read too well.  Perhaps the right question to ask is what are the already-existing examples of such diagrams, as I am sure some exist. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300409"> @AndréNicolas: Hello Andre Nicolas, thank you for this, it looks very interesting. I just had a look at the wiki page and it seems a bit complicated for me to understand, is it possible to explain intuitively about the diagrams used in this branch? It would make a good answer. Thanks again. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300411"> @Omnomnomnom: Good idea! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300412"> There are pretty diagrams behind descent processes in certain Diophantine equations, e.g. [Fibonacci's Lost Theorem](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/27317/242) = FLT<span class="math-container" id="10620835" visual_id="684681"><math alttext="{}_{4}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi></mi><mn>4</mn></msub></semantics></math></span> (FLT  for exponent $4).\ \ $ </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300426"> Number theory is closely tied to group theory, so consider the [Fano plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane) and [elliptic curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300435"> Very very elementary number theory can be visualized very effectively in the way Euclid did.

Modular arithmetic, for instance, can be visualized when the modulus is a prime power by translating the congruence into the metric language of p-adic distances. And, as quid pointed out, the link between number theory and algebraic geometry is another source of visual insight. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300438"> @BillDubuque: Hello Bill, thank you for your answer, it sounds like a pretty diagram, though I couldn't find it in the link. Is there somewhere else I can see it? Thanks </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300445"> @KCd: Hello KCd. It is hard to say exactly, but I appreciate in particular the proofs in divisibility theory, though they are usually very hard to find and contrived. It would be nice if we had a geometric way of viewing the reasoning. It may be a naive question, but I do not know much in mathematics so I apologize in advance if it seems like that. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300457"> I can recall such an example which seeks to find the number of solutions of the inequality <span class="math-container" id="10620841" visual_id="8438667"><math alttext="x^{2}+y^{2}\leqslant n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>y</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>⩽</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, for <span class="math-container" id="10620842" visual_id="993"><math alttext="n\in\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>ℕ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="10620843" visual_id="921"><math alttext="x,y" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> integers. It turns out that the ratio of the number of solutions over <span class="math-container" id="10620940" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> converges to <span class="math-container" id="10620845" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span> as <span class="math-container" id="10620940" visual_id="177"><math alttext="n" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi></semantics></math></span> increases, and this can be easily shown using geometrical methods.

Can you give a specific example? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300530"> @KCd: If you mean an example of a diagram in divisibility theory I'm afraid I don't know any, hence the question. However, a general type of problem I would like to see solved in a diagrammatic way is vieta jumping. However I don't want to restrict the question so much. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300552"> I was asking for an example of a *result* in divisibility theory. Vieta jumping..?!? That is not a term used in number theory, except (after looking it up) people who like contest problems. It looks like infinite descent. Are you saying you want to avoid *all* algebraic computations when solving a problem? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300570"> @KCd: Sorry, misread. (And yes, I solve contest problems.) Fermat's Little Theorem is a good one - not too easy, not too hard. No, I don't want to avoid algebraic computations (just like in euclidean geometry when you use algebra for computations, ratios, etc.), just ones that involve "number theoretic insight". Modular arithmetic is number theoretic insight. (Once you learn it, maybe not, but its invention was certainly insightful.) I believe we can give a new meaning to this term, but viewing number theory diagramatically. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2300756"> @KCd "Vieta jumping" is  essentially descent in a group of integer points on a conic (realized by reflection). It's a special case of results on Pell equations (e.g. many of the contest problems have to do with Richaud-Degert quadratics which have short continued fractions so small fundamental units). </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2312833"> https://illustratedtheoryofnumbers.wordpress.com/ </td></tr>
