<p>I want to be able to express set notations fluently in math fields used in machine learning, so I started reading <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Naive Set Theory by Halmos</a>.</p> <p>But I have been facing a lot of problems like :</p> <ol> <li>On pages 1-6 , I encountered <code>if and only if</code> and had to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">Wikipedia</a>, to actually understand it .</li> <li>Also , I had to search Math.SE to understand such sentences as :</li> </ol> <blockquote> <ul> <li><p>It is equally harmless if the letter used has already been used with   <em>"for some"</em> or <em>"for all"</em>. Recall that <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651620" visual_id="484180"><math alttext="x\ (x\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>x</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> means   the same as <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651621" visual_id="484181"><math alttext="y\ (y\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>y</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> ; it follows that a judicious   change of notation will always avert alphabetic collisions.</p></li> <li><p><em>" nothing contains everything "</em></p></li> </ul> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>Every page is a conundrum that requires huge amounts of mental gymnastics. I think I'm not ready to read the book, yet.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend a better introduction to informal set theory than <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Halmos</a> ?</p> <p><sup><strong>My Background :</strong> I majored in biology and attended calculus, statistics, real analysis, and linear algebra classes in a university. However, I dropped out of all math classes very early to focus on biology. Now, I want to learn math again. The high school didn't teach any theoretical foundation of math at all.</sup></p>

<tr><td comment_id="2537333"> You can try with : Derek Goldrei, [Classic set theory](https://books.google.it/books?id=1dLn0knvZSsC&amp;printsec=frontcover) (1996), but some "practice" with mathematical and logic symbolism is needed ... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537338"> You could start with the first two chapters of Discrete Mathematics by Rosen. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537371"> may I suggest, as a somewhat soft introduction, David Velleman's _How To Prove It_? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537384"> I liked Enderton better, but I haven't read neither of the books (Halmos, Enderton) to say. Just flipped through them for a few minutes. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537497"> Please note that "set notation" is quite different from set theory. While every mathematician is familiar with the former, a lot less are familiar with the latter, which is concerned with the theoretical foundations of the concept of set. I am not familiar with machine learning, but I doubt that it requires set theory. You might be better off studying some of the mathematics actually involved in machine learning, like statistics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538359"> "If and only if" is completely standard mathematical terminology. I'm extremely surprised you never came across it before given that you've taken courses in, e.g., real analysis. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538635"> And if you see "iff" in a maths book, that's not a misspelling, it's short for "if and only if". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539065"> @DavidRicherby Note that I never touched math for 7 years after I dropped out of math classes early, so I forgot almost all of math completely. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539154"> @Minsky I'm guessing that the field of machine learning doesn't require all that much set theory. Much as I enjoy it myself, a whole textbook on it seems a bit much for someone in your position. You may get all the set theory and logic you need if you work through the tutorial that comes with my proof software (free, full-function download available at  my website http://www.dcproof.com ). I have tried to simplify set theory and logic to make them more accessible to math students transitioning to more proof-based courses, more like the kind you would see in math textbooks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539216"> @Minsky , [How To Prove It](http://www.amazon.in/How-Prove-It-Structured-Approach/dp/0521675995) is quite a nice little book - especially for beginners ; it helps you get nicely primed and ready for Proofs , First-Order Logic , Set Theory , Functions etc. After that , I would suggest you to pick up [Rosen](http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) -- wonderful book with lots of problems :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4888953"> I personally think *How to prove it* is less formal on its logic part. If one wants to learn the logic on the right way, see "Logic, Sets and Recursion" by Robert Causey. Just read the Chapter 1 of that book, you'll know why I consider it to be more rigorous, formal and "right". </td></tr>

<p>While not exactly an introduction to set theory per se I considered <a href="https://www.math.vt.edu/people/day/ProofsBook/IPaMV.pdf">An Introduction to Proofs and the Mathematical Vernacular</a> by Martin V. Day to be of great help in getting acquainted with a number of concepts and notations.<br/> Although it's focus lies on reading, writing and checking proofs it provides all the necessary information to understand all those proofs. In my opinion it manages to keep the language simple and aids students to find their way by pointing out important caveats.</p>
