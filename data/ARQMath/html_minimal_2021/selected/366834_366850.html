<div id="question" question_id="366834">
<p>I just read this whole article: <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/SetTheory.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/SetTheory.pdf</a><br/> which is also discussed over here: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/356264/infinite-sets-dont-exist/">Infinite sets don't exist!?</a></p> <p>However, the paragraph which I found most interesting is not really discussed there. I think this paragraph illustrates where most (read: close to all) mathematicians fundementally disagree with Professor NJ Wildberger. I must admit that I'm a first year student mathematics, and I really don't know close to enough to take sides here. Could somebody explain me here why his arguments are/aren't correct?</p> <p><strong>These edits are made after the answer from Asaf Karagila.</strong><br/> <strong>Edit</strong> <span class="math-container" id="3910342" visual_id="286"><math alttext="\;" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi></mi></semantics></math></span> I've shortened the quote a bit, I hope this question can be reopened ! The full paragraph can be read at the link above.<br/> <strong>Edit</strong> <span class="math-container" id="3910343" visual_id="286"><math alttext="\;" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi></mi></semantics></math></span> I've listed the quotes from his article, I find most intresting:   </p> <ul> <li><em>The job [of a pure mathematician] is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live.</em></li> <li><em>To Euclid, an Axiom was a fact that was sufficiently obvious to not require a proof.</em></li> </ul> <p>And from a discussion with the author on the internet:</p> <p><em>You are sharing with us the common modern assumption that mathematics is built up from  "axioms". It is not a position that Newton, Euler or Gauss would have had a lot of sympathy with, in my opinion. In this course we will slowly come to appreciate that clear and careful definitions are a much preferable beginning to the study of mathematics.</em></p> <p>Which leads me to the following question: Is it true that with modern mathematics it is becoming less important for an axiom to be self-evident? It sounds to me that ancient mathematics was much more closely related to physics then it is today. Is this true ?</p> <blockquote> <h1>Does mathematics require axioms?</h1> <p>Mathematics does not require "Axioms". The job of a pure mathematician   is not to build some elaborate castle in the sky, and to proclaim that   it stands up on the strength of some arbitrarily chosen assumptions.   The job is to <em>investigate the mathematical reality of the world in   which we live</em>. For this, no assumptions are necessary. Careful   observation is necessary, clear definitions are necessary, and correct   use of language and logic are necessary. But at no point does one need   to start invoking the existence of objects or procedures that we   cannot see, specify, or implement.</p> <p>People use the term "Axiom" when   often they really mean <em>definition</em>. Thus the "axioms" of group theory   are in fact just definitions. We say exactly what we mean by a group,   that's all. There are no assumptions anywhere. At no point do we or   should we say, "Now that we have defined an abstract group, let's   assume they exist".</p> <p>Euclid may have called certain of his initial statements Axioms, but   he had something else in mind. Euclid had a lot of geometrical facts   which he wanted to organize as best as he could into a logical   framework. Many decisions had to be made as to a convenient order of   presentation. He rightfully decided that simpler and more basic facts   should appear before complicated and difficult ones. So he contrived   to organize things in a linear way, with most Propositions following   from previous ones by logical reasoning alone, with the exception of   <em>certain initial statements</em> that were taken to be self-evident. To   Euclid, <em>an Axiom was a fact that was sufficiently obvious to not   require a proof</em>. This is a quite different meaning to the use of the   term today. Those formalists who claim that they are following in   Euclid's illustrious footsteps by casting mathematics as a game played   with symbols which are not given meaning are misrepresenting the   situation.</p> <p>And yes, all right, the Continuum hypothesis doesn't really need to be   true or false, but is allowed to hover in some no-man's land, falling   one way or the other depending on <em>what you believe</em>. Cohen's proof of   the independence of the Continuum hypothesis from the "Axioms" should   have been the long overdue wake-up call. </p> <p>Whenever discussions about the foundations of mathematics arise, we   pay lip service to the "Axioms" of Zermelo-Fraenkel, but do we ever   use them? Hardly ever. With the notable exception of the "Axiom of   Choice", I bet that fewer than 5% of mathematicians have ever employed   even one of these "Axioms" explicitly in their published work. The   average mathematician probably can't even remember the "Axioms". I   think I am typical-in two weeks time I'll have retired them to their   usual spot in some distant ballpark of my memory, mostly beyond   recall.</p> <p>In practise, working mathematicians are quite aware of the lurking   contradictions with "infinite set theory". We have learnt to keep the   demons at bay, not by relying on "Axioms" but rather by developing   conventions and intuition that allow us to seemingly avoid the most   obvious traps. Whenever it smells like there may be an "infinite set"   around that is problematic, we quickly use the term "class". For   example: A topology is an "equivalence class of atlases". Of course   most of us could not spell out exactly what does and what does not   constitute a "class", and we learn to not bring up such questions in   company.</p> </blockquote>

Sounds like the definition of the "not constructive" close reason to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786986"> *So if you believe that the "set of all sets" doesn't make good sense, then how can the "category of all finite groups" be any better?* He is essentially arguing "If <span class="math-container" id="3910344" visual_id="599"><math alttext="B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi></semantics></math></span> doesn't make sense, why should <span class="math-container" id="3910345" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> make sense?" The *category* of sets makes perfect sense, and so does the category of finite groups, and the category of groups. The nonexistence of a set of sets has nothing to do with it. The epistemological foundations of category theory were carefully laid. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786987"> *The job [of a pure mathematician] is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live.* Nonsense. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786994"> @Zev: The title question is legitimate, and the question in the body has been rephrased. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="786996"> @ZevChonoles I changed it. I hope this topic doesn't get closed ! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787000"> If it is any comfort to you, there is no ned to take sides. Just do math. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787013"> @Kasper A word of caution: it would be counterproductive for you to try to understand mathematics by following what he says. It would probably be more fruitful to learn everything in the mainstream way, and then find places where he touches on a topic you are familiar with. *Starting* with what he is saying here is a surefire recipe for confusion. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787018"> While there may not be much more to say after Asaf’s answer, I have on principle voted to reopen the question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787026"> @BrianM.Scott I am not sure it is a sign that the question about some text should be open when a definitive answer starts with "TL;DR" </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787029"> @Michael: I take the question to be primarily the one in the title, the quotation serving mostly to provide context. And one can usefully address the question in the title without having read the context. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787037"> @Michael: It's not that I didn't read it at all. I glanced and read a bit from the quote. I edited that first line. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787043"> @Brian: I've always been skeptical of the effectiveness of pretending someone asks what you want them to have asked rather than what they did ask. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787048"> Kasper, you took away the reference to computer science, which renders the second point of my answer to be out of context. Please take into consideration existing answers when editing a question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787052"> Wildberger is a finitist, I believe, and thus takes a very unorthodox view versus most mathematicians. But this is why he references the "real world", and why Asaf brought up computer science (where there tend to be more finitists). To finitists, there are no infinite objects accessible in totality, which renders most mathematics problematic. But again, this is highly against the mainstream. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787056"> @Hurkyl: I fail to see the relevance of your comment. The question in the title is perfectly clear. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787057"> @trb456: I brought up computer science because it was mentioned in the original version of the question. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787101"> Is the question supposed to be "Does mathematics need axioms?" or "Does mathematics need axioms that conform to reality?". The answers below seem to be mixed between these two questions. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787106"> [Do we need axioms?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E781QE7ZQK8) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787108"> Before this question gets into a second volley of reopen votes, can someone please open a meta thread about this? I hate closure wars. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787116"> @AsafKaragila True. I didn't know there was a close/reopen thing before. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787129"> @PeterTamaroff So you vote to close the question, while not even reading the question up to the third paragraph ?? I clearly write: *I've shortened the quote a bit, I hope this question can be reopened !* </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787136"> @Kasper I have read the whole question. What makes you think I didn't? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787161"> @PeterTamaroff You said that you didn't know about the closing/reopen thing before. But as I write: "*I hope this question can be reopened*" this clearly implies that question was closed. But never mind. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787166"> @Kasper Well, I clearly missed that one. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="787171"> @Peter, Kasper: All those "clearly" are exactly the points I made in my answer where we skip rigor and make mistakes! (The proof that I am right is left as an exercise to the reader) :-) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789246"> "The job is to investigate the mathematical reality of the world in which we live." That sounds more like a mathematical physicist than a mathematician. Pure mathematics is, by definition, *divorced* from "practical" concerns. And that's a good thing, too. Why? Well, for one, there are many cases where a mathematical object was investigated for its own sake, independent of any connections to physical reality, and then found to have applications to physical reality! From a practical point of view, restricting math to "physical reality" would entail restricting to _what we know_ (cont'd) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789250"> (cont'd) about physical reality. And that would limit the amount of mathematical objects and results we'd have at our disposal when our knowledge increases. I'd imagine it'd slow down progress. Not good. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789263"> Oh yeah, and about "finitism" -- I think I should put here that if physicists ever discover the universe is in fact infinite (which is possible), then thanks to "infinitist" maths, we can be assured we'll be able to treat it correctly in whatever theories will be needed. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789275"> And even if it's not, the results obtained from mathematical models based on *abstract* infinite objects still prove to be very useful. Calculus requires a complete continuum to work, and even if real space is not a continuum after all, I don't think engineers would stop using calculus to build buildings. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789302"> I want to point out also that there's nothing wrong with _doing_ finitist math, but when you start claiming the other kind is all nonsense, then there's a problem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="797527"> @mike4ty4: Dear Mike, The author of the essay in question talks (in positive terms) about the Lie group <span class="math-container" id="3910360" visual_id="4914"><math alttext="G_{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></semantics></math></span>.  I doubt that he's unaware of the value and interest of pure mathematics, or of the difference between pure mathematics and physics or engineering.  I think it's possible to understand his essay in a slightly more nuanced manner than the one you are adopting.  Regards, </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="806935"> @Matt E: What would that slightly more nuanced manner be? Because it seems one of his objections to infinite sets/objects is that they cannot be "realized" in the "universe" (the real, physical universe). In other words, he seems to be implying that maths should be _restricted_ by physics and physical limits. If I'm wrong, _how am I wrong_, and _how else_ can it be interpreted? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="807136"> @Matt E: Also, is it possible to have an "axiomless" mathematics that also doesn't have physics-based limitations added in? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="813176"> Math doesnt have to be restricted, but the math that the universe follows is restricted, there is no "Leprechauns" or "infinite sets" in the real world, even though some claim that they can "imagine" it, or claim these concept makes sense (actually they are just meanigless symbols on a piece of paper). So you can divide math into two groups, meaningless useless philsophical math, and the real true theorems of the universe. </td></tr>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I didn't read the entire <strong>original</strong> quote in details, the question had since been edited and the quote was shortened. My answer is based on the title, the introduction, and a few paragraphs from the [original] quote.</em></p> <p>Mathematics, <em>modern mathematics</em> focuses a lot of resources on rigor. After several millenniums where mathematics was based on intuition, and that got <em>some</em> results, we reached a point where rigor was needed.</p> <p>Once rigor is needed one cannot just "do things". One has to obey a particular set of rules which define what constitutes as a legitimate proof. True, we don't write all proof in a fully rigorous way, and we do make mistakes from time to time due to neglecting the details.</p> <p>However we need a rigid framework which tells us what is rigor. Axioms are the direct result of this framework, because axioms are really just assumptions that we are not going to argue with (for the time being anyway). It's a word which we use to distinguish some assumptions from other assumptions, and thus giving them some status of "assumptions we do not wish to change very often".</p> <p>I should add two points, as well.</p> <ol> <li><p>I am not living in a mathematical world. The last I checked I had arms and legs, and not mathematical objects. I ate dinner and not some derived functor. And I am using a computer to write this answer. All these things are not mathematical objects, these are physical objects. </p> <p>Seeing how I am not living in the mathematical world, but rather in the physical world, I see no need whatsoever to insist that mathematics will describe the world I am in. I prefer to talk about mathematics in a framework where I have rules which help me decide whether or not something is a reasonable deduction or not.</p> <p>Of course, if I were to discuss how many keyboards I have on my desk, or how many speakers are attached to my computer right now -- then of course I wouldn't have any problem in dropping rigor. But unfortunately a lot of the things in modern mathematics deal with infinite and very general objects. These objects defy all intuition and when not working rigorously mistakes pop up more often then they should, as history taught us.</p> <p>So one has to decide: either do mathematics about the objects on my desk, or in my kitchen cabinets; or stick to rigor and axioms. I think that the latter is a better choice.</p></li> <li><p>I spoke with more than one Ph.D. student in computer science that did their M.Sc. in mathematics (and some folks that only study a part of their undergrad in mathematics, and the rest in computer science), and everyone agreed on one thing: computer science lacks the definition of proof and rigor, and it gets really difficult to follow some results.</p> <p>For example, one of them told me he listened to a series of lectures by someone who has a world renowned expertise in a particular topic, and that person made a horrible mistake in the proof of a most trivial lemma. Of course the lemma was correct (and that friend of mine sat to write a proof down), but can we really allow negligence like that? In computer science a lot of the results are later applied into code and put into tests. Of course that doesn't prove their correctness, but it gives a "good enough" feel to it.</p> <p>How are we, in mathematics, supposed to test our proofs about intangible objects? When we write an inductive argument. How are we even supposed to begin testing it? Here is an example: <strong>all the decimal expansions of integers are shorter than <span class="math-container" id="3910348" visual_id="1505691"><math alttext="2000^{1000}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2000</mn><mn>1000</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> decimal digits.</strong> I defy someone to write an integer which is larger than <span class="math-container" id="3910349" visual_id="1505692"><math alttext="10^{2000^{1000}}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><msup><mn>2000</mn><mn>1000</mn></msup></msup></semantics></math></span> explicitly. It can't be done in the physical world! Does that mean this preposterous claim is correct? No, it does not. Why? Because our intuition about integers tells us that they are infinite, and that all of them have decimal expansions. It would be absurd to assume otherwise.</p></li> </ol> <p>It is important to realize that axioms are not just the axioms of logic and <span class="math-container" id="3910350" visual_id="46489"><math alttext="\sf ZFC" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝖹𝖥𝖢</mi></semantics></math></span>. Axioms are all around us. These are the definitions of mathematical objects. We have axioms of a topological space, and axioms for a category and axioms of groups, semigroups and cohomologies.</p> <p>To ignore that fact is to bury your head in the sand and insist that axioms are only for logicians and set theorists.</p>

Are they mindless fanboys or do they actually think you make sense? 1st paragraph is based of the speculative idea that the real world is not mathematical. This contradicts all of modern physics for a start. 2nd paragraph contains alot of questions, maybe you should post them as separate questions, and not as an answer? Your text in bold is false, it can be proved mathematically, without appealing to the number of particles in the *visible* universe, which doesnt seem relevant when you have already dismissed modern physics in your 1st paragraph. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="788874"> @Igor: No, your comment is based on a speculative idea that the real world is somehow mathematical. The fact that physics describes the world using mathematics doesn't make it mathematical. I can describe the world using Hebrew, that doesn't make the world Jewish. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="788907"> @Igor: To add on that, we can't even **know** that our description is accurate. Simply because we can't know for sure about anything, we cannot foresee whether or not in some years from now someone will find a new form of physical objects which disobey the current theory and thus require the development of a new theory. So even if you can describe the world mathematically you cannot even begin to **prove** that what you write is the correct description. So I doubt that modern physics claims anything that the world is mathematical. At best, it can be approximated with mathematics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="788910"> @Igor: And lastly, what I wrote in boldface is indeed false. If you bothered to read my answer, and not skim over it quickly just to get to the comment section, then you would read that I make this bold claim that is irrefutable by empirical testing. Therefore physics which is ultimately tested empirically is not a good test for whether or not mathematics is "correct" somehow. It goes the other way around, since you insist that physics is speaking mathematics, mathematical reasoning should be a first-test for physical theories. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789540"> @Igor, only crazy people eat the menu instead of the food. The map is not the territory. Mathematics is not the physical world. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789581"> You cant describe how the world works in Hebrew. Religions dont work. You need math. Saying that the laws are approximate is saying the laws are false, they dont hold exactly always. Well then your actually dismissing all of modern physics and are nothing but a crackpot. What is provable isnt relevant, you cant prove that earth wasnt created yesterday, but thats not an argument that it was. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789596"> @Igor: Hebrew is a language, not a religion. The physical laws *don't* hold exactly always, and when it is discovered *how* they may fail to hold exactly, they are corrected to hold more closely with observations (cf. Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics). That's how science works--laws are not factual claims, only best (and usually very good) guesses. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789629"> @CameronBuie You clearly dont know what a physical **law** is. Or what string theory is. Do you think that if you have 10^8 data points within experimental accuracy, perfectly lined up with the function x^2, that its not actually x^2, but some more complicated formula? That the world follows some extremely complex formula that just 'happends' to line up with the simple x^2? There may be many languages that describes our observations, but the point is that string theory of much less complexity then all others, thats why the unvierse is mathematical. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789674"> @Igor: I think that with <span class="math-container" id="3910357" visual_id="76030"><math alttext="10^{8}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>8</mn></msup></semantics></math></span> data points, you can make an excellent guess. You seem to be inferring a great deal from a very few statements. I am familiar with string theory, and I like the concept. The universe is not mathematical in itself (Show me a <span class="math-container" id="3910368" visual_id="1294"><math alttext="\pi" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>π</mi></semantics></math></span>!), but we can use mathematics with great efficacy to describe it. The scientific method can never prove anything; it can only continue to disprove our flawed conceptions of the universe, thus refining our understanding and thereby (hopefully) leading us closer to the truth. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789694"> @Igor: Read some history of science. 200-or-so years ago people came up to the conclusion that "coldness", or temperature, is a particle. That is, there was a particle whose presence (in high concentrations) makes things colder. That was a perfectly reasonable theory, and people had a lot of hard time refuting it (even though some experiments did so rather early). Back then "cold particles" were physical **law**. Does that sound like a load of nonsense? Of course. You can't tell whether or not we got it right because we can't be sure. [cont'd] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789698"> @Igor: [...] And if you can't prove something, then insisting it is true requires you to **believe** it is true. The same way people **believe** there is, or that there is not, a god or fate, or karma. Your arguments are nothing more than religious zeal applied to physics and mathematics. You can't argue that religion is not science, but then treat science **exactly** as it were a religion. If you want science to transcend religion, you have to be open to the possibility that science as we know it is *wrong*. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789799"> @Igor I hope your last sentence means you are going to shut up now. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789804"> Thats the craziest thing I ever heard, do you really think the fact that the sun rises tommorow is a matter of belief? There is no reasoning involved in making this prediction? This is religion? And do you think that because someone once said something wrong, means that everyone else forever will be wrong? I am open to science beeing wrong, and the probability of that is around 0.001%, if thats the strongest argument you can produce, I guess we are done here </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="789965"> @Michael: If only :\ </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790452"> @Igor: you clearly don't understand what (<span class="math-container" id="7781820">p</span>hysical) science is. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790601"> @IgorUltra I don't know if you study physics or math or neither. But I don't think you have yet encountered a moment in your life when you feel absolutely humbled by the realization of how little you know. I hope one day you could feel that. It is a good thing. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790643"> @AsafKaragila I <span class="math-container" id="7783253">t</span>otally agree with what you are writing. That is why I think a true scientist/mathematician is humble. In math you can't prove more then an implication (Gödel's incompleteness theorems). And in (physical) science, you assume that: *Measurement/observations that are not dependent on the observer (i.e., is objective), that appears the same no matter who observes it, give us true information about "reality".* Therefore I conclude : I know I think and I think I know not more.  (inspired by Descartes) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790646"> My post sounds a little redundant after what mezhang write, but I can began writing it before mezhang posted ! </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790721"> @Kasper: I think that is often a good measure of mathematicians. They tend to humble themselves, they know that even though mathematics is considered an "absolute truth", it is perfectly reasonable that the theory they work with will turn out to be inconsistent; or that their proofs will end up wrong. Of course no one really talks about it, but I think that everyone has that little devil on their shoulder reminding them this possibility. I think that most serious scientists are aware of this as well, but I don't know. To the masses, and probably to Igor too, science is a new form of religion. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790889"> “The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.” ― Neil deGrasse Tyson </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="790964"> I agree that humbleness is important, and that "all scientists are wrong and I am right, scientists know nothing" is not humble. Humbleness is accepting that other people might know better then you and that you may have misunderstood some basic facts about nature. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="791339"> @Igor, if you want to quote others, let's quote Karl Popper who defined a scientific theory as something which is disprovable. Then (1) if physics is **law** then it is undisprovable and therefore not a science; and (2) the "fact" that the world is mathematical is not disprovable, and is therefore not a scientific theory. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="791391"> Exactly, thats why Poppers definition is nonsense and dismissed by modern physicists. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="791395"> @Igor: So... you pretty much says "What I decide is science, is science. It cannot not work. It cannot be wrong." you sound to me like the church, "What I decide is right, is right. It is the word of God. It cannot be wrong". Sounds pretty religousy to me. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="792816"> @AsafKaragila: Feeding the trolls may be hazardous for your health. Nice answer. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="792838"> By the way, it's interesting to note that there are many people, especially physicists, who espouse something like Igor's point of view. For example Stephen Hawking in his book "A Brief History of Time" definitely gave the impression (when I read it 20 years ago) that he thought of the mathematical models describing the universe are primary, and the universe as something that arose from the mathematics. He even asked something along the lines of "What breathes the life into the equations?" To me this sounds like a modern version of Plato's world of forms [ctd] </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="792842"> ... But I think there are a number of problems with this modern version of Platonism, even though it seems to wrap up things very neatly. For one it purports to explain the universe by positing an entire other universe (the universe of pure mathematics) and an unknown mechanism that produces physical reality from this universe. In actual fact, mathematics and physical reality appear to be intertwined at multiple levels in Hofstaderian strange loops. I don't think we're going to find a simple picture that explains the relation between mathematics and physical reality in a neat package. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="792847"> @<span class="math-container" id="7801829">G</span>rumpy: I agree o<span class="math-container" id="7801835">n</span> the last comment. I think that we are too simplistic as creatures. Especially regarding things which are infinite. We don't know almost anything about non-well ordered objects (if the universe turns out to be some crazy infinite set, we're doomed, and my work will be come applicable... the horror!), and even when we do deal with infinite objects most people don't comprehend beyond the separable in which we can approximate everything by finitary means (i.e. Cauchy sequences). Luckily we don't really need this for doing science, much like not all set theorists are Israeli. :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="798691"> After reading over the answer and the comments I immediately was reminded of something the Physicist-Mathematician Gauss once said: "Mathematics is the queen of sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics. She often condescends to render service to astronomy and other natural sciences, but in all relations she is entitled to the first rank." From my understanding number theory introduces some of the first axioms of mathematics (but then again I understand very little math as compared to all the math that exists (or rather has been thought of)) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="895607"> Just rediscovered this bunch of comments. Igor's point of view is good for a laugh ("Religion is bad! Here's mine! Except it isn't one!") The only downside to rediscovering this is that now I can't respect Neil deGrasse Tyson as much. :( </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="938639"> Its not about describing what has already happened (postdiction), its about prediction. Can you find the date for the next solar eclipse in Hebrew, or the mass of the Higgs-boson? And you also need to pair it with a convincing argument that what you did isnt mathematics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1318385"> Once again, XKCD is relevant… http://xkcd.com/435/ </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4373656"> I agree with @IgorUltra, except about [string theory](https://xkcd.com/171/).  The difficulty is when you ask him to "prove his statement *mathematically.*"  That's not possible.  However, I can state the *basic assumption* that **I** proceed from about the nature of the universe itself, which I am sure Igor will agree with: **The physical universe is predictable.**  (cont'd) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4373662"> (cont'd) Contrast that with this set of assumptions which I do *not* hold: "All mathematics proceeds from arbitrarily assumed axioms.  'Truth' has no meaning if it does not mean 'mathematically proven.'  No fact, statement, rule, law, theorem, axiom or assumption is *inherently* more valid than any other; truth is entirely arbitrary and meaningless, only dependent what assumptions you make."  No.  **That rule or principle which allows you to *accurately predict* is inherently more valid than one which does not.**  (Predict what?  The accurately observed behavior of the physical universe.) </td></tr>
