                        <p>It's been years since I took calculus, and while I have a good understanding of the theorems of single variable calculus from my real analysis courses, computationally I am a bit slow. It takes me longer than it should to compute basic derivatives and integrals, and I don't really remember how to do all the standard problems from differential/integral calculus (related rates, volume of a solid of revolution, etc.). I can typically derive the needed solution if necessary but I'd like to start doing some private tutoring and so I'd need to be able to explain the problems at a level the students would understand.</p>  <p>Also, I have some gaps in my knowledge of multivariable calculus, as I took it seven years ago and have not used much of it since then. In particular I don't remember anything about line integrals, surface integrals, Green's theorem, flux, divergence, etc. </p>  <p>What are some good books/references I can use to brush up on this material? As far as my background, I have a master's degree in a math-related field and took PhD level courses in real analysis, operator theory, probability theory, and stochastic processes, so I would like to be proving the theorems as I go along. But I also need to do plenty of example problems like you would see in an undergraduate calculus sequence so I can be quick at solving them.</p>
