<p>I want to be able to express set notations fluently in math fields used in machine learning, so I started reading <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Naive Set Theory by Halmos</a>.</p> <p>But I have been facing a lot of problems like :</p> <ol> <li>On pages 1-6 , I encountered <code>if and only if</code> and had to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">Wikipedia</a>, to actually understand it .</li> <li>Also , I had to search Math.SE to understand such sentences as :</li> </ol> <blockquote> <ul> <li><p>It is equally harmless if the letter used has already been used with   <em>"for some"</em> or <em>"for all"</em>. Recall that <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651620" visual_id="484180"><math alttext="x\ (x\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>x</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> means   the same as <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651621" visual_id="484181"><math alttext="y\ (y\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>y</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> ; it follows that a judicious   change of notation will always avert alphabetic collisions.</p></li> <li><p><em>" nothing contains everything "</em></p></li> </ul> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>Every page is a conundrum that requires huge amounts of mental gymnastics. I think I'm not ready to read the book, yet.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend a better introduction to informal set theory than <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Halmos</a> ?</p> <p><sup><strong>My Background :</strong> I majored in biology and attended calculus, statistics, real analysis, and linear algebra classes in a university. However, I dropped out of all math classes very early to focus on biology. Now, I want to learn math again. The high school didn't teach any theoretical foundation of math at all.</sup></p>

Just flipped through them for a few minutes. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537497"> Please note that "set notation" is quite different from set theory. While every mathematician is familiar with the former, a lot less are familiar with the latter, which is concerned with the theoretical foundations of the concept of set. I am not familiar with machine learning, but I doubt that it requires set theory. You might be better off studying some of the mathematics actually involved in machine learning, like statistics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538359"> "If and only if" is completely standard mathematical terminology. I'm extremely surprised you never came across it before given that you've taken courses in, e.g., real analysis. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538635"> And if you see "iff" in a maths book, that's not a misspelling, it's short for "if and only if". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539065"> @DavidRicherby Note that I never touched math for 7 years after I dropped out of math classes early, so I forgot almost all of math completely. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539154"> @Minsky I'm guessing that the field of machine learning doesn't require all that much set theory. Much as I enjoy it myself, a whole textbook on it seems a bit much for someone in your position. You may get all the set theory and logic you need if you work through the tutorial that comes with my proof software (free, full-function download available at  my website http://www.dcproof.com ). I have tried to simplify set theory and logic to make them more accessible to math students transitioning to more proof-based courses, more like the kind you would see in math textbooks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539216"> @Minsky , [How To Prove It](http://www.amazon.in/How-Prove-It-Structured-Approach/dp/0521675995) is quite a nice little book - especially for beginners ; it helps you get nicely primed and ready for Proofs , First-Order Logic , Set Theory , Functions etc. After that , I would suggest you to pick up [Rosen](http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) -- wonderful book with lots of problems :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4888953"> I personally think *How to prove it* is less formal on its logic part. If one wants to learn the logic on the right way, see "Logic, Sets and Recursion" by Robert Causey. Just read the Chapter 1 of that book, you'll know why I consider it to be more rigorous, formal and "right". </td></tr>

<blockquote> <p>I want to be able to express set notations fluently in math fields   used in machine learning.</p> </blockquote> <p>A book on set theory probably isn't the right place to be looking. Here's my advice:</p> <ol> <li><p>Start off by trying to understand "propositional logic" (aka "boolean logic".) Start by Googling terms like "introduction to propositional logic." Perhaps get yourself a good introductory book on logic. Following sylvia's advice, consider getting your hands on <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521675995">How To Prove It</a> and/or similar books. </p></li> <li><p>Once you understand propositional logic, make it your goal to understand "first-order logic." Try googling "introduction to first-order logic" and/or similar search terms. </p></li> <li><p>Seriously, make sure you understand first-order logic. Being able to express one's ideas correctly using first-order logic is arguably one of the most important skills a mathematician must possess.</p></li> <li><p>Realize that you don't have to use set-builder notation to express yourself unambiguously.

<tr><td comment_id="2539151"> Does 'how to prove it' by velleman teach all I need to know? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539198"> @Minsky , it is quite a nice little book - especially for beginners ; it helps you get nicely primed and ready for Proofs , First-Order Logic , Set Theory , Functions etc. After that , I would suggest you to pick up [Rosen](http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) -- wonderful book with lots of problems :) Happy 'Math'ing :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539401"> Your phrasing in point 4 is very convoluted. Why not just say that "Let <span class="math-container" id="11651654" visual_id="115"><math alttext="X" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi></semantics></math></span> be the subset of <span class="math-container" id="11651635" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> containing exactly those elements that blah"? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539529"> @pranav How is discrete mathematics going to help me with my journey toward machine learning algorithms? Does it help me understand 'naive set theory' better? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539538"> Hi , @Minsky , discrete math is going to teach you logic , set theory , functions , a spattering of number theory , combinatorics , graphs , trees , automata theory , primarily . Amongst these , the most useful for ML would be Set Theory , functions , Combinatorics , Graph Theory and Trees . You will gain an insight into how to use principles like `Pigeonhole Principle` without any fuss . All this stuff , you will encounter while studying ML , so better to be comfortable beforehand . Hope this helps :) Any further questions , I am happy to answer :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539548"> @Minsky, also the math that you actually , really want to learn is : Linear Algebra , Probability and Statistics  ;  set theory etc. you can pick up on the way , IMO . Have a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) . Also , besides the math , learn programming in <span class="math-container" id="23482477">1</span>-<span class="math-container" id="23482478">2</span> languages preferably [Python](https://www.python.org) and some others amongst Java , C++ , Haskell etc. :D </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539563"> @pranav I am already a good web programmer, and I want to become a very competent full-stack engineer and a machine learning researcher. I thought linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, and optimization theory were enough for machine learning. Can any of the fields I listed substitute discrete mathematics? I'd rather skip 800 pages of madness if possible. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539571"> @Mins<span class="math-container" id="23482698">k</span>y , if you are comfortable with writing proofs , playing around with the mathematical notation that ML Research entails , you are good to skip discrete math . Also , you do not need to read 800 pages . Do what you feel is comfortable - mostly a hit-and-trial approach (but it works !) :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539612"> Hi @Minsky, I h<span class="math-container" id="23477379">a</span>ve tried to address your dou<span class="math-container" id="23477380">b</span>ts [here](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1235724/does-set-theory-help-understand-machine-learning-or-make-new-machine-learning-al/1249605#1249605) , hope that helps :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2540398"> @DavidRicherby, your suggestion is a good one if we don't need to mention the variable <span class="math-container" id="11651651" visual_id="67"><math alttext="x" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math></span>. If we do, I do think my suggestion is not so bad. It has certain advantages. In particular, the phrasing I give makes it clear that anywhere you see <span class="math-container" id="11651632" visual_id="1839"><math alttext="x\in A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>, you can write "therefore blah", and anywhere you see "blah", you can write "therefore <span class="math-container" id="11651632" visual_id="1839"><math alttext="x\in A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>." The symmetry is clear. I also like making it very explicit that <span class="math-container" id="11651635" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> is a subset of <span class="math-container" id="11651654" visual_id="115"><math alttext="X" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi></semantics></math></span>, which my phrasing does. If you can see how to shorten the whole thing without losing these qualities, I'd be interested to hear your ideas. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2540535"> @goblin Fair enough, but note that my suggested phrasing make it clear that we're defining a subset of the original set (albeit that I accidentally put <span class="math-container" id="11651629" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="11651628" visual_id="115"><math alttext="X" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>X</mi></semantics></math></span> the wrong way around). </td></tr>
