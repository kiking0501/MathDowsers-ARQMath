<p>I will be taking analysis course in a month from now. Topics are given below. I am doing engineering and had been through calculus courses but nothing like sort of analysis before. Many of my friends who are engineers themselves have warned me about the difficulty and abstraction level of this course. Can some one suggest what should i do in order to learn it properly. I will be sitting with maths majors and donot want to look dumb. Any books for self study or whatever will be appreciated.Any tips or help thanks..</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>MAL411 Topics in REAL ANALYSIS, 4 (3-1-0)</p> <p>Course contents :  <strong>Metric spaces, completeness, connectedness, compactness, Heine-Borel theorem, totally bounded sets, finite intersection property, completeness of R^n, Banach fixed point theorem, perfect sets, the Cantor set.  Continuous functions, relation with connectedness and compactness, discontinuity, uniform continuous functions, monotone functions, Absolutely continuous functions, total variation and functions of bounded variations.  Differentiability and its properties, mean value theorem, Taylor's theorem, Riemann integral with properties and characterization, improper integral, Gamma function, Directional derivative, Partial derivative, Derivative as a linear transformation, Inverse and Implicit function theorems, multiple integration, Change of variables.

<p>Step 1: get comfortable with how to write proofs. This is not so easy, and really must come with lots of practice and experience. Reading guides (like <a href="http://math.mit.edu/classes/proofsiap/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>) with examples and trying to write very simple proofs yourself (and comparing yours with theirs) will be very helpful. My experience is that in a first course in analysis, many students have no proof writing experience, and this is not addressed by professors despite the fact that the entire course is proof based.</p> <p>Step 2: intuition and concepts are very important to have. Often these courses are taught in a very definition <span class="math-container" id="16855730" visual_id="7792"><math alttext="\to" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>→</mo></semantics></math></span> theorem <span class="math-container" id="16855731" visual_id="7792"><math alttext="\to" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>→</mo></semantics></math></span> definition <span class="math-container" id="16855732" visual_id="7792"><math alttext="\to" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>→</mo></semantics></math></span> theorem <span class="math-container" id="16855733" visual_id="16731"><math alttext="\cdots" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi mathvariant="normal">⋯</mi></semantics></math></span> manner, and the proofs are presented as in Rudin's book: lots of (correct!) but otherwise unmotivated (to a non-analyst, like a student) steps which get you from <span class="math-container" id="16855734" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> to <span class="math-container" id="16855735" visual_id="599"><math alttext="B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi></semantics></math></span>... somehow. This isn't how people come up with proofs, though. They use intuition and concepts to come up with the idea and then carefully translate these using the formalization into a rigorous proof. So, my advice here is to use many different resources (not just Rudin) to really understand what's going on. It's not so hard to "understand" a proof by reading through it line by line and verifying what's said is true, but it's another thing to generate proofs on your own, and this requires a degree of understanding gotten only from finding a source of information that "jives" with you and your way of learning/thinking.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="3725911"> I was about to give a similar comment to this one, and I strongly agree with what is being suggested here. In a 400-level Real Analysis class, it is implicitly assumed that you are familiar and comfortable with writing proofs from scratch (given only hypothesis and the previous results in the book/class). That is not an easy skill to just pick up and be good at, I had plenty of familiarity with proofs before I ever took a 400-level class and I still found it challenging at first (I eventually got pretty good it, practice really is key).
