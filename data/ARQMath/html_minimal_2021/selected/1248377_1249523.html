<p>I want to be able to express set notations fluently in math fields used in machine learning, so I started reading <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Naive Set Theory by Halmos</a>.</p> <p>But I have been facing a lot of problems like :</p> <ol> <li>On pages 1-6 , I encountered <code>if and only if</code> and had to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">Wikipedia</a>, to actually understand it .</li> <li>Also , I had to search Math.SE to understand such sentences as :</li> </ol> <blockquote> <ul> <li><p>It is equally harmless if the letter used has already been used with   <em>"for some"</em> or <em>"for all"</em>. Recall that <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651620" visual_id="484180"><math alttext="x\ (x\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>x</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> means   the same as <em>"for some <span class="math-container" id="11651621" visual_id="484181"><math alttext="y\ (y\in A)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mpadded width="+5pt"><mi>y</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mpadded></mrow></semantics></math></span>"</em> ; it follows that a judicious   change of notation will always avert alphabetic collisions.</p></li> <li><p><em>" nothing contains everything "</em></p></li> </ul> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>Every page is a conundrum that requires huge amounts of mental gymnastics. I think I'm not ready to read the book, yet.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend a better introduction to informal set theory than <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1614271313">Halmos</a> ?</p> <p><sup><strong>My Background :</strong> I majored in biology and attended calculus, statistics, real analysis, and linear algebra classes in a university. However, I dropped out of all math classes very early to focus on biology. Now, I want to learn math again. The high school didn't teach any theoretical foundation of math at all.</sup></p>

Just flipped through them for a few minutes. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2537497"> Please note that "set notation" is quite different from set theory. While every mathematician is familiar with the former, a lot less are familiar with the latter, which is concerned with the theoretical foundations of the concept of set. I am not familiar with machine learning, but I doubt that it requires set theory. You might be better off studying some of the mathematics actually involved in machine learning, like statistics. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538359"> "If and only if" is completely standard mathematical terminology. I'm extremely surprised you never came across it before given that you've taken courses in, e.g., real analysis. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2538635"> And if you see "iff" in a maths book, that's not a misspelling, it's short for "if and only if". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539065"> @DavidRicherby Note that I never touched math for 7 years after I dropped out of math classes early, so I forgot almost all of math completely. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539154"> @Minsky I'm guessing that the field of machine learning doesn't require all that much set theory. Much as I enjoy it myself, a whole textbook on it seems a bit much for someone in your position. You may get all the set theory and logic you need if you work through the tutorial that comes with my proof software (free, full-function download available at  my website http://www.dcproof.com ). I have tried to simplify set theory and logic to make them more accessible to math students transitioning to more proof-based courses, more like the kind you would see in math textbooks. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539216"> @Minsky , [How To Prove It](http://www.amazon.in/How-Prove-It-Structured-Approach/dp/0521675995) is quite a nice little book - especially for beginners ; it helps you get nicely primed and ready for Proofs , First-Order Logic , Set Theory , Functions etc. After that , I would suggest you to pick up [Rosen](http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) -- wonderful book with lots of problems :) </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="4888953"> I personally think *How to prove it* is less formal on its logic part. If one wants to learn the logic on the right way, see "Logic, Sets and Recursion" by Robert Causey. Just read the Chapter 1 of that book, you'll know why I consider it to be more rigorous, formal and "right". </td></tr>

<div answer_id="1249523" id="answer">
<p>I think you're reading the wrong book. Of course, if you want to continue reading Halmos for fun and/or the intellectual challenge, that's great, but what you're doing is the equivalent of trying to learn to drive by reading books about automotive engineering. A more mathematical analogy would be to think back to the courses you took on calculus and real analysis: the calculus course was about how to use differentiation and integration to solve problems, whereas the analysis course is about how differentiation and integration work "under the hood".</p> <p>For machine learning, you will be a user of sets and you might do some calculation on sets but you won't be doing research into what sets <em>are</em> and what are the limits of what they can do. For your purposes, you don't really need to know what's "under the hood" and it will be entirely sufficient to say that a set is a collection of objects defined by some stated property. Yes, that way lies Russell's paradox but Russell's paradox only comes up if you use "weird" properties to define sets and you won't be going anywhere like that. In particular, essentially all the objects you'll come across that you might want to describe as "sets" will be subsets of something that definitely is a set, such as the integers. In those areas, set theory works in just the way you'd expect it to.</p> <p>The first chapter of any undergrad textbook on general discrete mathematics will almost certainly contain all the set theory you need for machine learning.</p>

You're using the fact that the integers are a set, or that your graph has a power set, and the availability of separation (or bounded comprehension). This is more than you claim in your answer, and the difference is exactly where understanding Russell's paradox. I'm not advocating for the OP to sit and plow through Jech and Kunen, or even through all of Halmos' book. I'm only pointing out that "those weird properties" might not be so weird, and that you need to understand a bit more than the minimal use, in order to make good use. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539584"> Yes, I'm <span class="math-container" id="23482793">a</span>ssuming all of those things. Just like every<span class="math-container" id="23482794">b</span>ody who uses m<span class="math-container" id="23482795">a</span>thematics just assumes that the real num<span class="math-container" id="23482796">b</span>ers exist and have the obvious properties. As a computer scientist, almost every collection of objects I deal with is finite; almost all of the rest are countable and pretty much all the rest are finite unions of real intervals. So, yes, I can just assume that everything I want to call a set is a set and has all the expected properties. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="2539588"> One possible hiccup here is that machine learning involves a lot of probability so might involve some measure theory. I can imagine that that would require some actual set theory. </td></tr>
