<p>I can prove that these two statements are equivalent, but I can't make sense of them logically.  For instance, if P = "have a cold", Q = "have a headache", and R = "go see a doctor" then the statement:</p> <p>If you have a cold then go see a doctor or if you have a headache then go see a doctor.</p> <p>Is equivalent to:</p> <p>If you have a cold and a headache then go see a doctor?</p> <p>This to me does not make sense because the left side is saying if you have a cold OR a headache see a doctor, but the right side of the equation is saying if you have a cold AND a headache go see a doctor.</p> <p>Can someone help clarify this for me?</p> <p>EDIT:   </p> <p>I forgot to add that this is from the book "How to Prove It" by Daniel Velleman, of which I double checked and the equivalence is written in the book just as I wrote it. </p> <p>Also, I think the author is trying to make me see a contrast between the two statements:</p> <p>(i) (P→R)∧(Q→R)≡(P∨Q)→R [I understand this statement]</p> <p>(ii) (P→R)∨(Q→R)≡(P∧Q)→R [I don't understand this statement]. </p> <p>Both statements, at least as written in the book, are true.</p>

<p>The mathematical aspect of the question has already been answered, so let me say something about the intuitive aspect, which caused the difficulty in the first place.  I think the problem (or at least part of it) is that we are not accustomed to thinking about disjunctions of implications.  We see implications all the time, for example in civil laws, but we don't often have a choice of which law to obey.  But I think, once the issue is brought into the open, we can think about such disjunctions without too much difficulty.  In the example at hand, suppose that you had a choice between obeying a law that says "If you have a cold, then you must go to the doctor" and another law that says "If you have a headache, then you must go  to the doctor."  In such a situation, if you had a cold <em>and</em> a headache, you would have to go to the doctor.  Even though you can choose which law to obey, either choice will require you to go to the doctor.  But if you had <em>only</em> a cold or <em>only</em> a headache, then you could avoid going to the doctor, by choosing to obey the law that doesn't apply to your actual condition.  So the ultimate effect of the two laws and your option of choosing between them is exactly the same as the ultimate effect of a single law saying "If you have  both a cold and a headache, then you must go to the doctor."</p>
