<p>Over the course of my studies I often encounter phrases in reference material of the type <em>"and this avoids the need for using <span class="math-container" id="6420049" visual_id="46"><math alttext="\epsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ϵ</mi></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="6420050" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span> definitions"</em> or <em>"by this we can omit those complicated <span class="math-container" id="6420051" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> arguments"</em>, etc. In other words performing stunts in order to get around <span class="math-container" id="6420052" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>. I've seen enough of this to think that it should be categorized as <em>epsilondeltophobia</em>, if you all will permit. Personally, I was thrilled to learn definitions in these terms because it was one of the first rigorous definitions given to me, all in terms of quantifier logic, <em>and</em> it was used for very fundamental things whose real meaning I always wondered about. In the beginning of course I didn't have a clue how to use the language, but I loved it anyways because it was like, "wooow, <em>deep</em> maan". Not to mention that later on, I began to see that all of the higher-order constructions that were built upon <span class="math-container" id="6420053" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span>-objects worked out perfectly, giving me more satisfaction that whoever came up with <span class="math-container" id="6420054" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> language knew what they were doing. So I'm not saying that it's not ok to develop an <em>epsilondeltophobia</em>, as we all do naturally in the beginning...but textbooks (some) seem to promote this fear, even some teachers, and this is what I'm not happy about. I think <span class="math-container" id="6420055" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> is great.</p> <p>Question: who thinks likewise? oppositely?</p> <p>Edit: I don't want this to come off as a pedantic "rigor or death" statement, or as a suggestion that first courses on calculus should always include <span class="math-container" id="6420056" visual_id="1151"><math alttext="\epsilon,\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> (although maybe yes in mathematics).

As soon as you have a higher-level command for a loop, you should not program a loop in assembly language because it is both hard to do and both hard to understand. In the same vein, you use the definition to prove properties of limits and continuous functions and then you use these properties instead of the definition.

The key issue is to choose the "right" properties to prove. If you later need <span class="math-container" id="6420065" visual_id="7479"><math alttext="\varepsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ε</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="6420169" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span> again, this is a sign that you are missing an appropriate general property.

<tr><td comment_id="1333858"> As I say to my students: "If you don't understand it, you are not allowed to use it". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1333938"> As is the state of things, math is in fact an annoying means to an end for a lot of people. I hope you'll agree that this is not desirable. Now I'm not saying someday we'll live in a magical world where everyone from all disciplines loves math as well, but if we can at least move towards an education where abstractions and the occasional formal definition are not refused or feared by learners, that would be quite ok. I mean without these you can end up arguing over terms that were never defined and nobody actually knows what they're talking about and it's all just a big mess. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334223"> @GPerez I don't know. In principle valuing abstraction is attractive to us as mathematicians. But if you were a hairdresser, you'd want people to value the art and science of hair care. Ultimately, I just want a haircut, and so I pay a professional who does understand those things to do it for me. I appreciate what they do, but I will never appreciate it enough to study it. So it goes for mathematics, too. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334407"> It's not just a "misplaced ideal", but also a practical necessity.  Because math departments teach calculus, and because many (in some schools most or even all) students are required to *take* calculus, the math department becomes hugely important.  If calculus-for-engineers were outsourced to the engineers, math departments would probably have about the same stature as philosophy departments. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334416"> @Ryan Reich what do you mean by stature? Also keep in mind college works differently all around the world. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334424"> @GPerez I mean importance to the administration. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334442"> @Arkamis You're probably right, but I meant more in the fields of physics,engineering,biology, etc. Surely abstraction is fundamental to any science. But wait! It's important in literature, for example, too! One abstracts in order to analyze what a book or story is trying to get across. In music I can't even begin to list the ways in which abstraction from multiple, seemingly different songs to the concept of *a* song, viewed as chord progressions, scales which go along with each chord or key, things called "modes", etc. I don't think many can be saved from using abstract definitions </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1334737"> I think it's important to recall that, historically, the <span class="math-container" id="6420121" visual_id="1149"><math alttext="\epsilon-\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>δ</mi></mrow></semantics></math></span> definition came more than a hundred years so after the initial development of calculus.  One would guess from this that the definition is not completely obvious, although it seems like it after the fact.  It's also some seems to be evidence that it's possible to use calculus for practical purposes without a completely rigorous foundation by modern mathematicians' standards. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1335239"> @JairTaylor, you can have a completely rigorous foundation *and* infinitesimals. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1336686"> @user72694, that's true, I've heard you can, although I've never studied that myself.  But I believe the current theory of infinitesimals in nonstandard analysis is pretty different from the original nonrigorous thinking of Newton, Leibniz and co. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1339908"> @JairTaylor, the hyperreals are rather different from Newton's various approaches, but there are important similarities with Leibniz's approach; see [this article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y). Whether or not Leibniz's thinking was "nonrigorous" depends on what exactly you mean by that; if you mean that Leibniz did not use Cantorian set theory, then you are certainly right. If you mean that Leibniz's procedures are very different from hyperreal procedures, you will find information to the contrary in the article. If you mean that Leibniz's approach contained... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1339909"> ...logical contradictions, then arguably this is a persistent error of calculus historiography; see the article cited above. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1341538"> Very i<span class="math-container" id="12469159">n</span>teresting, thanks for the info!  I suppose I was under the i<span class="math-container" id="12469160">m</span>pressio<span class="math-container" id="12469163">n</span> that a lot of confusion from the era stemmed from not maintaining a clear distinction between definitions and theorems - e.g., debates about whether imaginary numbers and infinitesimals "really existed" or not, which lead to a lot of nonrigorous reasoning by modern standards.  But I haven't looked much into Leibniz's views, so perhaps I'm wrong. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343022"> "It turns out that engineers, scientists, and financial folks need to use calculus, but they don't need to understand calculus." Wow, what a clear statement of what seems implicitly to be the dominant position in the contemporary pedagogy of freshman calculus...and which I find to be alarming and pernicious bordering on repugnant.  I wish we college math teachers could have an explicit discussion to see whether we really believe this and fully understand its implications. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343037"> Two opening salvos: (i) Both real world exposure to young people and much research bears out the hypothesis that almost everyone begins their study of (e.g.) mathematics wanting to understand everything.  The tragedy of mathematics education is that we beat this desire out of 99% of the students so systematically and thoroughly that by the time they get to calculus they have a Stockholm syndrome level identification with their torturers. (ii) In contemporary society, the name for the thing that does calculations without conceptual understanding is "computer", not "engineer". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343045"> @PeteL.Clark Indeed. I think it's sad (at best) and dangerous (at worst), but I have a hard time convincing myself that it's not true. As a career engineer, most of my contemporaries can do calculus, but cannot do epsilon-delta proofs. And honestly, they do not need to. Engineering is more than computation. Engineering is about judgment and design and decision making. Adding technical rigor doesn't necessarily *directly* improve those things. I'd rather the chemical engineer who designs my shampoo have a good understanding of risks and proper mixing and safety. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343049"> That said, engineers also recognize this deficiency, and good firms do hire mathematicians (which is how I ended up with the title 'Engineer'). Nevertheless, there are plenty of mathematically-deficient engineers who should absolutely not be; recently, I had to explain the Riemann-Stieltjes integral to someone who professed himself to be an expert in game theory. That's just kind of sad. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343050"> @Arkamis: It is really unclear how much treatment of epsilon-delta is necessitated in order to "understand calculus", so it is a bit dangerous to use the former as a synecdoche for the latter.  (In particular, you say engineers do not need to do <span class="math-container" id="6420168" visual_id="46"><math alttext="\epsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ϵ</mi></semantics></math></span>-<span class="math-container" id="6420169" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span> proofs: yes, I agree.)  When I teach calculus, the desire to at least attempt to present the material in an intellectually coherent way leads me to present a positive, but very small (!!), amount of <span class="math-container" id="6420168" visual_id="46"><math alttext="\epsilon" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ϵ</mi></semantics></math></span>-<span class="math-container" id="6420169" visual_id="41"><math alttext="\delta" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>δ</mi></semantics></math></span>...and I do so in a different and more geometric way than calculus textbooks seem to think is necessary for "rigor". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343062"> Let me also say -- if I can say something without wanting to back it up in these comments -- that I have often been less than favorably impressed with the amount of "understanding of calculus" evinced by the way calculus textbooks are written.  A lot of times what mathematics textbooks at this level call "rigor" I would be tempted to call "pedantry brought on by a limited, fragile understanding". </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343174"> @PeteL.Clark I agree 100% with all of that. Epsilon-delta is just one part of understanding, and not the complete picture. Nevertheless, I think you'd be appalled if you tracked down some engineering students, asked them to compute the derivative of a function, and then asked them to explain the definition of a derivative. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343405"> It seems to me that for the engineer it is especially important to be able to estimate the result they need, and to know how to compute to within a desired degree of accuracy.  The "exact" answer is rarely available, and for an approximation to be worth anything, it must be controlled ( accuracy to within 1 kilogram is very different from accuracy to within one gram).  Epsilon delta analysis is simply learning how to make rigorous error analysis.  I wish it were taught this way... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343683"> Arkamis: No "tracking down" will be necessary: I have taught and am currently teaching engineering students (and thus I cannot disagree with your assessment, unfortunately).  @Steven: yes, I wholeheartedly agree!  It took me a while to figure out that this is what applied analysis was actually about: controlled estimates rather than exact answers.  Last semester when I taught calculus I spent *several lectures* on numerical integration, I topic I had completely skipped in the past. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343688"> Unfortunately students are not well trained in estimation of any kind.  I remember well from last semester when I decided to strategically retreat from asking them any exam questions on Taylor's Theorem with Remainder (too hard; I would be testing degrees of rote memorization rather than any real understanding) in favor of the Alternating Series Error Estimate, which is so technically simple that there is nothing other than understanding the basic idea required.  Still it was a challenging topic... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343709"> @PeteL.Clark This discussion definitely highlights a need for dialog on the role of mathematics education at all levels. But I feel like a lot of mathematicians often get caught up in mathematics when these discussions come up, as if they feel the need to justify their existence by enforcing the teaching of concepts they feel important. I still maintain that an engineer or financial analyst does not need to understand calculus to the degree that a mathematician does. Nevertheless, there is much value in training these students in the practice of mathematical thinking. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343715"> And that holds true at all levels. Focus on what things *mean*, rather than how to *do* them. A good proxy of a measure of success for a mathematical curriculum would be to eliminate the question all mathematicians eventually get: "so what is it that you *do*?" </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343748"> "I still maintain that an engineer or financial analyst does not need to understand calculus to the degree that a mathematician does."  Well, sure.  You could hardly become a mathematician without ta<span class="math-container" id="12487933">k</span>ing 5-10 additional deepening your understanding of various aspects of calculus.  I think that freshman calculus should not contain the aspects of abstraction or attention to foundational ideas that occurs even in later undergraduate courses.  But some idea that continuity means that the error in the output can be controlled arbitrarily well by restricting the input seems important. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1343771"> @PeteL.Clark Of course. But what's the solution? Textbooks suck. Curricula in a typical 4-year program are so compactified as to not allow any freedom for spending time on learning material beyond what is strictly necessary. Students don't care (and neither do employers -- worse, in many cases neither do graduate schools). What to do? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1344172"> @Arkamis: Well, the first step is to identify and agree on the problem.  And then....can I get back to you? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1349015"> @PeteL.Clark "When I teach calculus, the desire to at least attempt to present the material in an intellectually coherent way..." **This** sums up what I believe, that presenting mathematics without coherence, e.g. things deducted from others, proofs, is what ultimately leads to alienation from mathematics itself. When someone is capable of asking "is <span class="math-container" id="6420126" visual_id="2289964"><math alttext="\frac{1}{a+b}=\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>a</mi></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>b</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>?", they clearly have not learned what any of those operations mean, or else the answer would be obvious. That was a horrible example as it happens at an early level, where one is first learning math, but... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1349030"> ... I hope you know the kind of thing I'm talking about. We could argue, as some have, that (insert_profession) doesn't need to *use*  an understanding of math. Well It depends on what we mean by "use"; A friend of mine teaches biology in a masters degree (where students are supposed to be at a level of conceptual maturity), and tells me that he finds it *impossible* to make his students understand the "epistemological hierarchy" of ideas, i.e. what concepts are deducted from others, in which order implications go, etc. He says that, rather, the material is just taken in as... </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="1349040"> ... "loose bits of information", and therefore the students come up with equivalent questions (in biology) as the example two comments above. These students could or could have certainly *used* an education in mathematics such as is presented to a pure mathematician crowd. In other words, what he says is "*learn to reason, kid.*" So I'm not sure if (insert_profession) doesn't have to *use* an understanding of mathematics. </td></tr>
