<p>Any sound and complete formal system in propositional logic consists of:</p> <p>1.- A finite number of <strong>Variables</strong> (Symbols used as placeholders for proposition).</p> <p>2.- At least one <strong>logic connective</strong> </p> <p>3.- At least one <strong>Rule of inference</strong> (For example, Modus Ponens)</p> <p>4.- A set of <strong>axioms</strong></p> <p>Any proposition stated using the variables and connectives should be provable from the axioms using the rule/s of inference.  </p> <p>Using these ingredients, one may construct many valid formal systems of propositional logic using different combinations of connectives, rules of inference and axioms. </p> <p>For example, a famous axiomatization by Jan Łukasiewicz uses the connectives → and ¬ , Modus Ponens and the following three axioms: </p> <p>ϕ→(ψ→ϕ)</p> <p>(ϕ→(ψ→ξ))→((ϕ→ψ)→(ϕ→ξ))</p> <p>(¬ϕ→¬ψ)→(ψ→ϕ)</p> <p>Using this axiomatization as an example, my <strong>question</strong> is the following: </p> <p>Are the truth tables for → and ¬ taken for granted when choosing said connectives as fundamental, or are they constructed from the axioms and modus ponens? </p> <p>In other words, are truth tables part of the Definition of logic connectives, or is the definition of said connectives completely included in the axioms and rules of inference (with truth tables being merely a consequence of something more fundamental)?</p>

Those axioms are satisfied by nontrivial truth tables for any number of propositional values, especially there only being 1 truth value.

What I don't understand completely is, once we take said tables for granted,  why do we need to define the three axioms in the example, or any axiom at all? The axioms are easily demonstrated using truth tables, as is any other tautological statement, so I don't see any particular reason to take them for granted. Does it have something to do with the way modus ponens is used? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5026224"> In propositional logic, the truth table method is enough to check if a formula is a *tautology* or not; thus, in principle, the axioamtic  calculus is dispensable. With "more complex" logic, like predicate calculus, such a method is not available; thus, in order to find the *valid* formulas, we need a proof, i.e. axioms and rules. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5031607"> @DanielV I agree with your comment, but NOT your example.  If we only have one truth value, then there exist tautologies which don't exist in classical logic such as any variable. </td></tr>

<p>(I am going to collect many good points from comments.)</p> <p>I guess that the confusion stems from the phrase “the definition of logic connectives”. It seems that you believe that we need to <strong>define</strong> logical connectives in order to do any mathematics at all. Think what kind of definition it could be. Mathematics is based on logic. If there ware <strong>the</strong> mathematical definition of logical connectives, that would be a vicious cycle.</p> <p>Now I consider a practical definition of logical connectives. A practical definition should help in determining whether a given mathematical statement is true or false. We can calculate the truth value of any formula in propositional logic by truth tables. If the truth value is true, the formula is true. If the truth value is false, the formula is false. Hence truth tables are practical for propositional logic.</p> <p>Unfortunately, propositional logic is too poor for describing any interesting mathematical statement. The best attempt of using truth tables for quantifiers is to interpret quantifiers as logical connectives spanning the whole domain of discourse. For example, <span class="math-container" id="22528225" visual_id="64317"><math alttext="\forall xP(x)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∀</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> when the domain of discourse is natural numbers means <span class="math-container" id="22528226" visual_id="4728727"><math alttext="P(0)\land P(1)\land P(2)\dots" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>∧</mo><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>∧</mo><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">…</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span> and so on for all natural numbers. As the set of all natural numbers is infinite, we can’t calculate the truth value of <span class="math-container" id="22528227" visual_id="64317"><math alttext="\forall xP(x)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∀</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>. Truth tables are not practical for a logic with quantifiers, for example, any first-order logic.</p> <p>A quote from the textbook “Introduction to Mathematical Logic” by Elliott Mendelson (2015, 6th ed., Chapter 2.3 “First-Order Theories”) that further elaborates on difficulties of the calculation approach to truth.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the case of the propositional calculus, the method of truth tables   provides an effective test as to whether any given statement form is a   tautology. However, there does not seem to be any effective process   for determining whether a given wf is logically valid, since, in   general, one has to check the truth of a wf for interpretations with   arbitrarily large finite or infinite domains. In fact, we shall see   later that, according to a plausible definition of “effective,” it may   actually be proved that there is no effective way to test for logical   validity. The axiomatic method, which was a luxury in the study of the   propositional calculus, thus appears to be a necessity in the study   of wfs involving quantifiers, and we therefore turn now to the   consideration of first-order theories.</p> </blockquote> <p>We can salvage the calculation approach if we reason about logical connectives by truth tables and about quantifiers by other means. I guess this is possible in informal reasoning. However, in formal reasoning, inference systems are used. If a statement is proved using an inference system which is believed to be correct, then the statement is true. This is the answer to the question why axioms are needed: they are a practical way to determine whether a given mathematical statement is true or false. The inference system that you described belongs to the class called Hilbert systems. Actually, Hilbert systems are not very practical: proofs are unnecessarily long. Natural deduction is better.</p> <p>As many inference systems were invented during formalization of mathematics, a natural question is which is better. In order to decide it, we need to know their properties and compare them. This is done in theoretical mathematical logic. In order to study inference systems, formal definitions of a well-formed logical formula and a proof were introduced. Logical connectives are just syntactic constructs, symbols. Then the notion of semantics (interpretation) of logical connectives and quantifiers was introduced. Truth tables are a part of semantics. Semantics helps to prove statements about provability. Semantics is a theoretical definition of logical connectives. This is the answer to the question why truth tables are needed.</p> <p>Notice that the whole study of inference systems is going inside an inference system belonging to the metalevel. This inference system is usually left implicit, and reasoning in it is written in a natural language. Inference systems that are studied belong to an object level. These 2 levels are a characteristic property of theoretical mathematical logic.</p> <p>A view on logical connectives that you want to adopt depends on your objective. If you care about practical proving, meaning of logical connectives is defined by inference systems. Semantics is useful for theoretical investigations, but is not practical.</p>

<tr><td comment_id="5030404"> So, if I'm understanding correctly, you could, in the case you chose to use the negation and conditional connectives for example, find out what the truth tables for both of them are using the three axioms and modus ponens, OR you could use the truth tables inestead, using them as the starting point to prove the three axioms and any other tautological statement (taking the truth tables of the conditional and negation for granted, of course). However, using axioms and rules of inference is the preffered approach, because it can be extended to first order logic. Am I right? </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5047605"> @JuanEsteban Valdez: In theoretical mathematical logic, it is proved (the completeness theorem) that any logically valid proposition is provable in the standard inference systems. A proposition is *logically valid* if it evaluates to T for any values of propositional variables. Using this result, if we find a logically valid proposition, we know that it is provable, hence it is true. IMHO, this corresponds as close as possible to your demand to “prove the three axioms and any other tautological statement”. The problem is that I do not really understand what you want. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5047641"> @JuanEsteban Valdez: “you could … find out what the truth tables for both of them are using the three axioms and modus ponens” I doubt that we can find truth tables by some technique or calculation procedure. It is proved that the usual truth tables “corresponds” to the usual inference systems. Formally speaking, this correspondence is (the soundness theorem) that every proved proposition is logically valid. I guess this is where you “prove the three axioms” and modus ponens. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5047658"> @JuanEsteban Valdez: Actually, it is possible to prove rows of the truth tables. For example, it is possible to prove in your inference system <span class="math-container" id="22528228" visual_id="4728728"><math alttext="A\implies B\implies A\lor B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⟹</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>∨</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="22528229" visual_id="4728729"><math alttext="A\implies\lnot B\implies A\lor B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>∨</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="22528230" visual_id="4728730"><math alttext="\lnot A\implies B\implies A\lor B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mo>⟹</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>∨</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, <span class="math-container" id="22528231" visual_id="4728731"><math alttext="\lnot A\implies\lnot B\implies\lnot(A\lor B)" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><mo>⟹</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>∨</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></span>, etc. It looks like finding out truth tables. And these small facts may be used in the proof of the completeness theorem. </td></tr><tr><td comment_id="5047665"> @JuanEsteban Valdez: At the end of the day, the approach depends on your objective: to prove mathematical theorems rigorously, to create an automatic prover or a proof assistant, to dive into theory of logic; whether propositional logic is sufficient for your objective. </td></tr>
