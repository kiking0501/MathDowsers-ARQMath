<p>When it is said that there are infitely many points on a line, does it imply anything about the cardinality of set of all points on a line?

<p>There seem to be two distinct questions here: the title question, and the body question "When it is said that there are infinitely many points on a line, does it imply anything about the cardinality of set of all points on a line?" These have different answers. The answer to the latter is: "It implies that the cardinality is infinite." Saying that a set is infinite is just a statement about the set's cardinality, in the same way that saying that a set has five elements is a statement about the set's cardinality. </p> <p>So with regard to that, I think you may be over-thinking what "there are infinitely many ..." means - it just means exactly that, that the set of [things] is infinite, or has infinite cardinality.</p> <hr/> <p>Meanwhile, the title question has a reasonably exact answer. Different sets, infinite or otherwise, can be compared by considering <em>injections</em>; we say <span class="math-container" id="24153110" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span> has cardinality at least that of <span class="math-container" id="24153111" visual_id="599"><math alttext="B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi></semantics></math></span> if there is an injection from <span class="math-container" id="24153112" visual_id="599"><math alttext="B" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>B</mi></semantics></math></span> to <span class="math-container" id="24153113" visual_id="188"><math alttext="A" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>A</mi></semantics></math></span>. (There are various alternatives we can use here, which are equivalent <em>if</em> we assume the axiom of choice; in general, some care needs to be taken.) Two sets have the same cardinality if there are "injections both ways;" by  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cantor-Bernstein theorem</a>, this is the same as the existence of a bijection (note that this does <em>not</em> require choice!).</p> <p>Using this language, we can show that each of the following sets have the same cardinality:</p> <ul> <li><p>The set of points on a line, as usually understood (e.g. a line in Euclidean space); that is, the cardinality of <span class="math-container" id="24153114" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span>.</p></li> <li><p>The set of points on a plane: the cardinality of <span class="math-container" id="24153115" visual_id="5401"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}^{2}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></semantics></math></span>.</p></li> <li><p>The set of infinite sequences of zeroes and ones.</p></li> <li><p>The set of infinite sequences of natural numbers.</p></li> <li><p>The set of sets of natural numbers.</p></li> </ul> <p>The cardinality of all these sets is denoted "<span class="math-container" id="24153116" visual_id="18817"><math alttext="2^{\aleph_{0}}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2</mn><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">ℵ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></msup></semantics></math></span>." Another important fact is that these sets are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument" rel="nofollow noreferrer">uncountable</a>.</p> <p>There are, interestingly, some basic facts about this cardinality which are <em>not</em> known, and in fact known to not be establishable from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the usual axioms of set theory</a>. Chief among these is whether there is any cardinality "strictly between" that of <span class="math-container" id="24153117" visual_id="5897"><math alttext="\mathbb{N}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℕ</mi></semantics></math></span> and <span class="math-container" id="24153118" visual_id="448"><math alttext="\mathbb{R}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>ℝ</mi></semantics></math></span> (which are different since the latter is uncountable). This question is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">continuum hypothesis</a>, and it is known that the usual ZFC axioms of set theory cannot resolve the question one way or another. But that's going fairly far afield, so I'll stop there.</p>
