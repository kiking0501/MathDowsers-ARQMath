Taking the limit as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_76\">$\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_77\">$\\delta \\rightarrow 0$</span> one can see that the integral <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_64\">$$\\int_C \\frac{(-z)^s}{e^z-1}\\frac{dz}{z}$$</span> becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_65\">$$(e^{i\\pi s}-e^{-i\\pi s})\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$</span> and then the rest follows easily from known identities satisfied by the Gamma function.

    "Question": "<p>As we know, triangular numbers are a sequence defined by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_276\">$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$</span>. And it's first few terms are <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_277\">$1,3,6,10,15...$</span>. Now I want to calculate the sum of the sum of triangular numbers. Let's define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_273\">$$a_n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_274\">$$b_n=\\sum_{x=1}^na_x$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_275\">$$c_n=\\sum_{x=1}^nb_x$$</span> And I want an explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_278\">$c_n$</span>. After some research, I found the explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_279\">$b_n=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$</span>. Seeing the patterns from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_280\">$a_n$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_281\">$b_n$</span>, I figured the explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_282\">$c_n$</span> would be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_283\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_284\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{12}$</span>.</p> <p>Then I tried to plug in those two potential equations,</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_285\">$n=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_286\">$c_n=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_287\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_288\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{12}=2$</span>. Thus we can know for sure that the second equation is wrong.</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_289\">$n=2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_290\">$c_n=1+4=5$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_291\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}=5$</span>.

However, I cannot prove, or explain, why that is. Can someone prove (or disprove) my result above?</p> ",

But then, I recalled the benchmark induction proof everyone learns,</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1031\">$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$</span></p> <p>Then kicks in the remains of all those calculus courses I once took, making me thing that, hey wait!
