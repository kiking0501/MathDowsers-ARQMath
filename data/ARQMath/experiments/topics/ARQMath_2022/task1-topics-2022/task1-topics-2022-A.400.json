  "Title": "What is the probability hat two particular players verse in Wimbledon if it begins with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1046\">$16$</span> players?",
  "Question": "<p>Sixteen people play in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. The winner of the quarter-finals play again in the semi-final to decide who enters the finals. <strong>What is the probability that two particular people will play each other if the tournament begins with 16 players?</strong></p> <p>So I have so far (case 1 + case 2) = verse player in quarter OR verse player in semi = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1047\">$\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{15}...$</span></p> <p>I'm not sure what else to include in the second case</p> <p>Also the third part of the question asks <strong>What is the probability when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1048\">$2^n$</span> players begin?</strong></p> <p>The worked solutions show <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1049\">$\\frac{1}{2^n-1}+\\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{n-2}}\\right)^2\\:=\\:\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$</span> which I cannot get. Even symbolab doesn't show the same simplification. As with the previous question, I do not understand the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1050\">$\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{n-2}}\\right)^2$</span></p> "
