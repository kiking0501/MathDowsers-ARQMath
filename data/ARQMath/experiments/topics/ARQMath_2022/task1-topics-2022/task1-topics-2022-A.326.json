  "Title": "Every projective module is a direct summand of free module.",
  "Question": "<p>I was reading \"Serial Rings\" by Gennadi Puninski. There it is written that , \"Since every module is a homomorphic image of a free module, every projective module is a direct summand of free module\".(ie. if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_317\">$P$</span> is a  projective module, there exists a free module F such that, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_318\">$ F=P \\oplus T$</span> for some module <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_319\">$T$</span>.)</p> <p>But I can't understand how \"Every module is a homomorphic image of a free module\" implies that \"Every projective module is a direct summand of free module\".</p> <p>(I have found a proof for \"Every projective module is a direct summand of free module\" but the first part of the above mentioned sentence wasn't used there.)</p> "
