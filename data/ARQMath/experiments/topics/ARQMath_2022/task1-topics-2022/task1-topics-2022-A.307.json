  "Question": "<p>By definition, the Carmichael function maps<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_55\">$a $</span>positive integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_52\">$n$</span> to the smallest positive integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_53\">$t$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_54\">$a^t\\equiv1\\pmod n$</span> for all integers <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_56\">$\\gcd(a,n)=1$</span>. It is denoted as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_57\">$\\lambda(n)$</span>.</p> <p>The Wikipedia page on Carmichael function states that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_58\">$\\lambda(n)=\\max\\{\\operatorname{ord}_n(a):\\gcd(a,n)=1\\}$</span>. My question is: why is this true? In other words, why is it the case that there always exists an integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_59\">$x$</span> coprime to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_60\">$n$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_61\">$\\operatorname{ord}_n(x)=\\lambda(n)$</span>?</p> "
