  "Question": "<p>So I am supposed to be proving that if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_633\">$p_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_634\">$p_2$</span> are distinct primes and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_635\">$p_1\\mid a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_636\">$p_2\\mid a$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_637\">$p_1p_2\\mid a$</span>, and I need to use Euclid's Lemma except as far as I understand Euclid's lemma is the converse of this statement and I have tried for the last few hours to work with Euclid's and GCDs to figure this one out and I just don't know where to start since I can't wrap my head around this one. Can anyone help me out?</p> "
