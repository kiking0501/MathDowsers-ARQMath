  "Question": "<blockquote> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_122\">$a,b\\in G$</span>, a finite abelian group and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_123\">$|a|=r, |b|=s$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_124\">$\\gcd(r,s)=1$</span>. Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_125\">$|ab|=rs$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>My attempt:</em> Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_126\">$|ab|=n$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_127\">$G$</span> is ableian, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_128\">$(ab)^n=a^nb^n=1$</span>. Thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_129\">$r\\mid n$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_130\">$s\\mid n$</span>. Together with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_131\">$\\gcd(r,s)=1$</span>, it follows that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_132\">$rs\\mid n$</span>. This is where I'm stuck; need to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_133\">$rs=n$</span>. Any hints on how to proceed?</p> <p>Edit: I've come up with a solution that is a somewhat different approach to what has been provided in the hints. Here it goes:</p> <p>Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_134\">$G$</span> is abelian, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_135\">$n\\mid{\\rm lcm}(r,s)$</span>. But since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_136\">$\\gcd(r,s)=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_137\">${\\rm lcm}(r,s)=rs$</span> by an elementary result in number theory. Thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_138\">$n\\mid rs$</span>. Together with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_139\">$rs\\mid n$</span>, we have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_140\">$n=rs$</span>, which is what we want to prove.</p> "
