  "Title": "How can I evaluate <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_643\">$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}} $</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_644\">$k$</span> is a natural number?",
  "Question": "<p>I suddenly interested in the differential equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_645\">$$ f^{(k)}(x)=f(x) $$</span> So I tried to calculate for some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_650\">$n$</span>. When <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_651\">$ k=1 $</span>, we know the solution <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_646\">$$ f(x)=A_0e^x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{A_0x^n}{n!}} $$</span> Also, for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_652\">$ k=2 $</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_647\">$$ f(x)=Ae^x-Be^{-x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{A_0x^{2n}}{(2n)!}+\\frac{A_1x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!})} $$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_653\">$ A_0=A+B $</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_654\">$ A_1=A-B $</span>. Inductively, I could guess that the solution of the differential equation would be in the form <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_648\">$$ f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}{\\frac{A_ix^{kn+i}}{(kn+i)!}}} $$</span> But I could neither prove that it is the only solution nor get the explicit formula. How should I evaluate <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_655\">$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}} $</span>, cause if we know the answer for it, we can evaluate the original expression by differentiating it. Thanks to WolframAlpha, I know the answer for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_656\">$ k=3 $</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_649\">$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{x^{3n}}{(3n)!}}=\\frac{1}{3}(2e^{-\\frac {x}{2}}\\cos{(\\frac {\\sqrt{3}}{2}x)}+e^{x}) $$</span> I think the answer might related to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_657\">$ \\sin $</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_658\">$ \\cos $</span> of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_659\">$ \\frac {2\\pi}{k} $</span>.</p> "
