  "Question": "<p>Suppose that you have an orthonormal basis <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_141\">$\\{e_n\\}$</span> in a Hilbert space such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_142\">$\\sum \\|e_n-x_n\\| < 1$</span>. Is this condition enough to prove that the closed span of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_143\">$\\{x_n\\}$</span> is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_144\">$H$</span>?</p> <p>My efforts to prove this have not led anywhere promising. I have tried showing that the only vector perpendicular to all of the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_145\">$x_n$</span> would be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_146\">$0$</span>. Not sure which way I can proceed.</p> <p>Does anyone have an idea how to approach this? Thank you.</p> "
