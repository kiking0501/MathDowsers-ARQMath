  "Title": "When two dice are identical, why are ordered pairs considered for determining probability of getting sum x?",
  "Question": "<p><strong>Problem statement :<br /> +++++++++++++++</strong></p> <p>Given two identical unbiased dice, determine the probability of getting sum as 7.</p> <p>Event  = Sum of dots on the top face of both dice is 7.</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_532\">$E = {(1,6),\\ (2,5),\\ (3,4),\\ (4,3),\\ (3,4),\\ (5,2),\\ (6,1)}$</span><br /> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_533\">$|Sample Space|$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_534\">$36$</span>.</p> <p>Hence, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_535\">$P(E) = 1/6$</span></p> <p><strong>I have a doubt here.</strong> As the two dice are given identical, why do we have to consider ordered pairs?<br /> <strong>Shouldn't it be unordered consisting of only 3 possible pairs <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_536\">$\\{(1,6),\\ (2,5),\\ (3,4)\\} $</span>?</strong> Hence, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_537\">$|S| = 21$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_538\">$P(E) = 3/21$</span>.</p> "
