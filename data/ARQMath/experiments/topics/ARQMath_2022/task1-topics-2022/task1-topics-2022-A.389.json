  "Title": "Convergence of a Special Series as N is large",
  "Question": "<p>I'm trying to find a general formula for the series and x is a constant: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_959\">$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N  \\frac{i}{(1+r)^i}$$</span> I have deduced the general formula for the sum. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_960\">$$\\frac{(1+r)^{N+1}-(1+r)-rN}{r^2(1+r)^N}$$</span> Will this sum converge to some value when N is very large? Could someone explain how to deal with it?</p> "
