  "Question": "<p>I can't seem to be able to prove Kuratowski's Theorem using the Axiom of Choice, although they are equivalent assertions.</p> <p>Kuratowski's Lemma: Every partial order has a maximal chain.</p> <p>Axiom of Choice: For every set X of disjoint nonempty sets there exists a set<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_692\">$Y $</span>such that for every set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_685\">$Z \\in X, Y \\cap Z$</span> is a singleton.</p> <p><strong>My attempt:</strong> Consider any chain <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_686\">$C_0$</span> of the partial order. If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_687\">$\\exists x \\in X \\setminus C_0$</span> which is comparable with some element of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_688\">$C_0$</span>, let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_689\">$C_1 := C_0 \\cup \\{ x \\}$</span>. Iterate this process . If at some point we cannot find such an x, then we have found a maximal chain. Suppose we can find such an <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_690\">$x$</span> infinitely, then the sets <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_691\">$i\\geq 1 \\Rightarrow X_i := C_{i+1} \\setminus C_i$</span> are disjoint singletons. Hence by axiom of choice there exists <span class=\"math-container\">$Y$</span> for which <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_693\">$X_i \\subseteq Y$</span>. Inorder to finish the proof, I need to prove something of the form \"If a is comparable with some element of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_694\">$C_0$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_695\">$\\exists j$</span> s.t. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_696\">$a \\in C_j$</span>\". I can't seem to prove this.</p> <p>P.S: x is comparable with y iff <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_697\">$x R y \\lor y R x$</span>.</p> "
