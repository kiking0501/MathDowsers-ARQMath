Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_412\">$g:{\\Bbb N} \\to {\\Bbb N}$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_413\">$g(n) = {\\text{biggest positive integer d such that d|n and 1}} \\leqslant {\\text{d < n}}$</span>.</p> <p>Show that:<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_402\">$$g(n) = \\frac{n}{{L(n)}},\\forall n \\in {\\Bbb N}{\\text{ such that }}n \\geqslant 2$$</span></p> <p>My proof:</p> <p>Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_414\">$n \\geqslant 2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_415\">$n$</span> is either composite or prime.</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_416\">$n$</span> is prime(i.e <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_417\">$n = p$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_418\">$p$</span> is prime), then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_403\">$$g(n) = 1 = \\frac{p}{p} = \\frac{n}{{L(n)}}$$</span> This is because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_419\">$L(n)$</span> is defined as <strong>least prime factor of n</strong>.</p> <p>If<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_440\">$n $</span>is composite, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: \"Any positive integer bigger than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes.\" Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_420\">$p$</span> be the smallest prime of the product <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_404\">$$n = {p_1}^{{\\alpha _1}}p_2^{{\\alpha _2}}...{p_m}^{{\\alpha _m}},{\\text{ }}i < j,{\\text{ }}{p_i} < {p_j}{\\text{ and }}i,j \\in {{\\Bbb Z}^ + }{\\text{ and }}{\\alpha _i} \\in {{\\Bbb Z}^{ \\geqslant 0}}$$</span></p> <p>That is, pick <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_421\">$p = p_1$</span>. Notice that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_422\">$p$</span> is necessarily <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_423\">$L(n)$</span> because since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_424\">$p = p_1$</span> implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_425\">$p|n$</span> and is the <strong>smallest</strong> prime that divides n. Therefore, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_405\">$$p_1 = p = L(n)$$</span></p> <p>Then, if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_426\">$x = p = L(n)$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_427\">$1 < x < n$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_428\">$x|n$</span> (by definition). This implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_406\">$$\\exists y \\in {{\\Bbb Z}^ + }:y = \\frac{n}{x} = \\frac{n}{{L(n)}} = {p_1}^{{\\alpha _1} - 1}{p_2}^{{\\alpha _2}}...{p_m}^{{\\alpha _m}}$$</span> But <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_429\">$y|n$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_430\">$y < n$</span>. Implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_431\">$y$</span> is the greatest integer less than<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_442\">$n $</span>such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_432\">$y|n$</span>.</p> <p>Now let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_433\">$d = g(n)$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_407\">$$\\frac{n}{d} = \\frac{n}{{g(n)}} = m$$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_434\">$m$</span> is prime and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_435\">$m = p$</span>.</p> <p>BWOC, If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_436\">$n=md$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_437\">$m = ab$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_438\">$1 < a,b < m \\Rightarrow n = abd \\Rightarrow ad|n$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_439\">$1</span>. But we found another factor of <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_441\">$ad$</span>) that divides <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span>! This contradicts the definition of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_443\">$d=g(n)$</span>. Also, since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_444\">$d = g(n)$</span> is the biggest factor of n, implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_445\">$m = \\frac{n}{d} = \\frac{n}{g(n)}$</span> is the <strong>smallest prime factor of n</strong>. So <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_446\">$m = L(n) = p$</span>. Hence, we have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_408\">$$x = m = p = L(n) = \\frac{n}{g(n)} \\Rightarrow g(n) = \\frac{n}{p} =\\frac{n}{L(n)} = y$$</span> or just <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_409\">$$g(n) = \\frac{n}{L(n)}$$</span></p> <p><strong>Q.E.D.</strong></p> "
