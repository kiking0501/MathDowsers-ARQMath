  "Question": "<p>I am trying to prove the following function is continuous for all irrationals:</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_989\">$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0,  & \\text{if $x$ is irrational} \\\\ 1/n, & \\text{if $x = m/n$} \\end{cases}$</span></p> <p>The question assumes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_990\">$m/n$</span> is in lowest terms.</p> <p>I have shown that it is discontinuous for all rationals, and now I believe I have to either use the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_991\">$\\epsilon-\\delta$</span> definition of continuity or sequential continuity to show the function is continuous for when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_992\">$x$</span> is irrational.</p> <p>I split my attempt into two cases:</p> <p>Our value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_993\">$x$</span> is irrational, then I want: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_987\">$$\\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists \\delta > 0, |x-a|</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_994\">$a$</span> is irrational here.</p> <p>Using that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_995\">$x$</span> is irrational I get that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_996\">$f(x) = 0$</span> as does <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_997\">$f(a)$</span> so no matter the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_998\">$\\delta$</span> we have our condition for continuity  satisfied as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_999\">$0 < \\epsilon$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1000\">$\\delta$</span></p> <p>Our value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1001\">$x$</span> is rational i.e. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1002\">$x = \\frac{m}{n}$</span> subbing in we want: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_988\">$$\\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists \\delta > 0, |\\frac{m}{n}-a|</span></p> <p>I am struggling to find the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1003\">$\\delta$</span> necessary. I am able to bound <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1004\">$|\\frac{m}{n}-a|$</span> by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1005\">$1+2|a|$</span> if I say that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1006\">$\\delta \\le 1$</span>. However I do not know how to find a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1007\">$\\delta$</span> to yield the second inequality.</p> <p>Should I change my approach to sequential continuity?</p> "
