  "Title": "The Double Basel Problem",
  "Question": "<p>I have been playing with the series which I had been calling the 'Double Basel problem' for the past couple of hours<br /> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_299\">$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{{n^2 +m^2}}. $$</span> After wrestling with this for awhile, I managed to generalize a result demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYc9ManKC-s\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This identity is: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_300\">$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^2+m^2} = \\frac{1}{2x}\\left[ \\pi \\coth{\\pi x} - \\frac{1}{x}\\right]. $$</span> Hence the original series becomes: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_301\">$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2n}\\left[\\pi \\coth{\\pi n} - \\frac{1}{n} \\right]. $$</span></p> <p>I have no idea where to go next with this problem.  I seriously doubt that this series is convergent; however, I have been unable to prove it.</p> <ol> <li>Can you prove that this series is divergent?</li> <li>If it converges what is its value?</li> </ol> <p>Thanks so much!</p> "
