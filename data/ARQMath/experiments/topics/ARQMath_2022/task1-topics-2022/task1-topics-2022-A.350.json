  "Question": "<p>I want to proove that 2 and 3 divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_585\">$x^3 - x, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$</span> and I'm stuck at the inductive step, here's where I'm at:</p> <p>For all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_586\">$x \\in \\mathbb{N}$</span>, let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_587\">$P(x)$</span> be the  proposition:<br /> 2 and 3 divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_588\">$x^3 - x$</span></p> <p>Basic step:<br /> the first term in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_589\">$\\mathbb{N}$</span> is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_590\">$0$</span>, then: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_591\">$\\frac{0^3 - 0}{2} = 0$</span> et <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_592\">$\\frac{0^3 - 0}{3} = 0$</span>, thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_593\">$P(0)$</span> is true.</p> <p>Inductive step:<br /> For the inductive hypothesis, we assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_594\">$P(k)$</span> is true for an arbitrary nonnegative integer k bigger than 0. That is, we assume that 2 and 3 divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_595\">$k^3 - k$</span></p> <p>To carry out the inductive step using this assumption, we must show that when we assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_596\">$P(k)$</span> is true, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_597\">$P(k + 1)$</span> is also true. That is, we must show that 2 and 3 divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_598\">$(k+1)^3 - (k+1)$</span></p> <p>Is the next step here is that we need to prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_599\">$\\frac{(k+1)^3-(k+1)}{2}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_600\">$\\frac{(k+1)^3-(k+1)}{3}$</span> are integers? thus 2 and 3 divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_601\">$(k+1)^3 - (k+1)$</span>?</p> "
