  "Question": "<p>I want to solve this equation: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_259\">$3x+4y=14$</span></p> <p>I present you what I have so far:</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_260\">$\\gcd(3,4)=1$</span> which is not <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_261\">$14$</span>. I notice that: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_262\">$3(6) + 4(-1) =14$</span></p> <p>So using B\u00e9zout : <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_263\">$3(6-4k) + 4(-1+3k) = 14 (1)$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_264\">$k$</span> integer. So we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_265\">$k>1/3$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_266\">$k<3/2$</span>. So <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_267\">$k = 1$</span>. By replacing <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_268\">$k$</span> in equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_269\">$(1)$</span> we get: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_270\">$a=2, b=2$</span>, which indeed solves the equation. However, I dont get my previous solution <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_271\">$(a,b)=(4,-1)$</span> which is also correct.</p> <p>Am I applying B\u00e9zout wrong? Or am I not supposed to find the solution that I used to find the new ones, if they exist? Do I have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_272\">$2$</span> solutions and that's it or am I missing something? Thank you.</p> "
