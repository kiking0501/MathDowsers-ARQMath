  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_467\">$A$</span> be a square matrix. To show: Matrix exponential converges to some matrix <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_468\">$X$</span>.</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_464\">$$ \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^{N}\\frac{A^k}{k!}\u00a0=X  $$</span></p> <p>In some proofs that I have seen it is stated that because (for a sub-multiplicative norm) <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_465\">$$ 0 \\le  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left\\Vert  \\frac{A^k }{k!} \\right\\Vert  \\le \u00a0\\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\frac{\\Vert A \\Vert ^k }{k!}</span> then the series <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_469\">$\\sum_{k=0}^{N}\\frac{A^k}{k!}$</span> has to be convergent. That however isn't clear to me.</p> <p>To me more intuitive way to show convergence would be to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_466\">$$ \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left\\Vert \\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\frac{A^k}{k!} -X \\right\\Vert \u00a0=0$$</span> and use some intuitive matrix norm for which it is clear that all elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_470\">$\\frac{A^k}{k!} -X$</span> converge to zero.</p> <p>Any hints?</p> "
