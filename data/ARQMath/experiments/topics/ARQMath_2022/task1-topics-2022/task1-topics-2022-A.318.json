  "Question": "<p>How do you prove <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_208\">$e^{x} \\geq \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{n}$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_209\">$n \\geq 1$</span>? I can prove this for natural numbers only via induction, but how do you prove this for any real <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_210\">$n \\geq 1$</span>?</p> <p>We start with the base case <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_211\">$n=1$</span>. We have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_212\">$e^x \\geq 1+x$</span> by a variety of methods. For the induction step, assume <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_213\">$e^{x} \\geq \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{n}$</span>. Notice that taking the derivative of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_214\">$(1+\\frac{x}{n+1})^{n+1}$</span> gives us <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_215\">$(1+\\frac{x}{n+1})^{n}$</span> and thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_216\">$(1+\\frac{x}{n+1})^{n} < \\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{n} \\leq e^x = \\frac{d}{dx} e^x$</span>.</p> <p>I'm not sure how to extend this to the non-integer case. Any help would be appreciated.</p> "
