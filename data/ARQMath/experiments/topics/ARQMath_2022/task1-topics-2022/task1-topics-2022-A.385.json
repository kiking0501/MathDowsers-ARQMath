  "Question": "<p>In ring theory a given ring <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_903\">$R$</span> is called a Euclidean domain if there exists a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_904\">$\\sigma:R -\\{0\\}\\rightarrow \\{0,1,2,3...\\}   $</span> which satisfies the division algorithm i.e.<br /> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_905\">$ $</span> if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_906\">$a,b \\in R$</span> then there exists <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_907\">$q,r \\in R$</span> such that  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_908\">$b=aq+r$</span> and either <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_909\">$r=0$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_910\">$\\sigma(r)\\lt \\sigma(a) $</span></p> <p>Now I want to ask if we can prove, using just this definition that an element of larger degree won't divide an element of smaller degree. In specific rings such as</p> <p>(i) the integers</p> <p>we can say<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_899\">$$\\sigma(a)=|a|$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_900\">$$\\sigma(ab)=\\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$$</span></p> <p>ii) polynomials</p> <p>where<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_901\">$$\\sigma(f(x))=deg(f(x))$$</span><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_902\">$$\\sigma(ab)=\\sigma(a)+\\sigma(b)$$</span> So in both the above cases the size of product of two elements will always be greater than or equal to the size of individual elements and hence the larger element can never divide the smaller element. But is this true in general for all Euclidean domains ? And how will we prove that</p> "
