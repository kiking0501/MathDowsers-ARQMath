  "Question": "<blockquote> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_866\">$f\\colon [0,\\pi]\\to\\mathbb{R}$</span> be a continuous function.  If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_867\">$\\int^{\\pi}_{0}f (t) \\sin(t)dt =\\int^{\\pi}_{0} f (t) \\cos(t)dt = 0$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_868\">$f(x)=0$</span> admits two solutions in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_869\">$[0,\\pi]$</span></p> </blockquote> <p>I try to show if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_870\">$f(x)>0$</span> and then get the contradiction but I failed to prove that, so maybe can someone help me with that? thanks in advance.</p> "
