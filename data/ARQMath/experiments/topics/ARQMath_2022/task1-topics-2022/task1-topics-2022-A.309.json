  "Title": "Number of solutions of equation over a finite field",
  "Question": "<p>I have a question regarding the number of solutions of a equation over a finite field <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_91\">$\\mathbb{F}_p$</span>. First of all, consider the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_92\">$x^3=a$</span> over <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_93\">$\\mathbb{F}_p$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_94\">$p$</span> is a prime such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_95\">$p\\equiv 2 (\\text{mod }3)$</span>. The book that I'm currently reading says that this equation has exactly one solution in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_96\">$\\mathbb{F}_p$</span> for every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_97\">$a\\in \\mathbb{F}_p$</span>, because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_98\">$\\gcd(3,p-1)=1$</span>, but the book does not prove this. Unfortunately, this doesn't convince me enough. Is there is a convincing elementary straightforward proof justifying why is this true?</p> "
