  "Question": "<p>Ordinals in set theory are well-ordered by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_717\">$\\in$</span> or equivalently <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_718\">$\\subset$</span>. If we define all ordinals greater or equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_719\">$\\omega$</span> as infinite ordinals. Is it true that every infinite ordinal is equinumerous to its successors.</p> <p>Basically my question is the proof or refutation of the following statement:</p> <p>Given infinite ordinal <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_720\">$\\alpha$</span>. Does there exist an injection from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_721\">$\\alpha^+$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_722\">$\\alpha$</span>.</p> "
