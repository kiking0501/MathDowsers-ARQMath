  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_681\">$f:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$</span> be Riemann-integrable and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_682\">$F(x)=\\int_a^xf(t)dt$</span>.</p> <p>Is this function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_683\">$F$</span> always differentiable? Because the antiderivative is defined as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_684\">$F'=f$</span> right, so you would think that it always holds.</p> "
