  "Question": "<p>if GCD of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_566\">$(a, b) = 1$</span>, prove that GCD <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_567\">$(a+b, a-b) = 1$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_568\">$2 .$</span> The proof goes like: Let GCD <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_569\">$( a+b, a-b ) = d$</span> and let there exist integers m and n such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_570\">$ a+b =md$</span>  and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_571\">$ a-b = nd.$</span> By adding and subtracting these two equations we get: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_572\">$2a = (m+n)d$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_573\">$2b = (m-n)d$</span> , because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_574\">$a, b$</span> are coprime then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_575\">$2$</span> GCD <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_576\">$(a,b)$</span> = GCD <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_577\">$(2a, 2b),$</span> and so on.</p> <p>My question is, why do we have to add and subtract above equations? I need to understand the concept of this prove in some more details. Thanks!</p> "
