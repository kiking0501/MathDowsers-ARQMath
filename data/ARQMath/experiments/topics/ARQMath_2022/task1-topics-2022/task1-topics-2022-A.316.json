  "Question": "<p>I want to understand the group structure of the group of units in the ring <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_189\">$\\mathbb{Z}/2^m \\mathbb{Z}$</span> for positive integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_190\">$m$</span>. I expect this has been answered before here on MSE, but so far the automatic suggestions didn't turn it up.</p> <p>Here is what I understand: it is an abelian group, hence a product of cyclic ones. Also the order of this group is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_191\">$2^{m-1}$</span> so that the orders of the factors in the product are all powers of two by Lagrange's theorem.</p> <p>Now these conditions are restrictive enough to compute the first few cases by hand.</p> <p>We have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_192\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_193\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/4 \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_194\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/8 \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_2 \\times C_2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_195\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/16 \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_2 \\times C_4$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_196\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/32 \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_2 \\times C_8$</span>.</p> <p>I'm starting to believe that for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_197\">$m > 1$</span> we have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_198\">$(\\mathbb{Z}/2^m \\mathbb{Z})^* = C_2 \\times C_{2^{m-2}}$</span> but is there a simple conceptual explanation for that (if true)?</p> "
