  "Question": "<p>In a problem, the substitution <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_675\">$$\\tan\\theta=\\frac{x}{2}$$</span> was made. In the end, the answer was in terms of sines, and to convert back, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_677\">$sin\\theta$</span> was defined as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_676\">$$\\sin\\theta=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4+x^2}}$$</span> This is a typical example of some stuff about integration I'm struggling to understand;</p> <p>(1) Why are the absolute values of square roots <em>never</em> taken? This is something I keep seeing in every situation involving an integral. (Here, if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_678\">$\\theta$</span> is in the third quadrant, sines would be negative and tans would be positive. So this definitely doesn't work for the third quadrant.)</p> <p>(2) Expanding upon the stuff in the parantheses up there, a possible explanation is that while doing trig substitutions, the angle is <em>always</em> a principal angle of the inverse trigonometric operation on whatever you're making the substitution. Is there such a rule?</p> "
