  "Title": "Backwards Induction (Exercise 2.2.6) Analysis 1 by Terence Tao",
  "Question": "<p>I am new to the study of analysis and I decided to start with Terence's book in my endeavor. I want to show my \"proof\" of backwards induction since I have some difficulty in understanding this. I want to now if my proof is correct or have some error, because if have,<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_166\">$a $</span>can't infer that. Any feedback is appreciated.</p> <hr /> <blockquote> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_147\">$n$</span> be a natural number, and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_148\">$P(m)$</span> be a property pertaining to the natural numbers such that whenever <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_149\">$P(m\\text{++})$</span> is true, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_150\">$P(m)$</span> is true. Suppose that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_151\">$P(n)$</span> is also true. Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_152\">$P(m)$</span> is true for all natural numbers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_153\">$m \u2264 n$</span>; this is known as the principle of backwards induction. (Hint: apply induction to the variable <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_154\">$n$</span>.)</p> </blockquote> <p>First i want to show <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_155\">$P(m)$</span> is true <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_156\">$\\forall$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_157\">$0\\geq m$</span>.</p> <p>H1: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_158\">$\\forall m$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_159\">$P(m\\text{++})\\implies P(m)$</span></p> <p>H2: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_160\">$P(0)$</span></p> <p>C: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_161\">$P(m)$</span> is true <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_162\">$\\forall$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_163\">$0\\geq m$</span>.</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_164\">$0\\geq m$</span> means <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_165\">$0=m+a$</span> for some natural number <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_167\">$m=a=0$</span> for corollary 2.2.9. But <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_168\">$P(0)$</span> is true for H2, then the case <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_169\">$n=0$</span> is proved.</p> <p>Suppose now that works for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_170\">$n$</span> and prove <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_171\">$n\\text{++}$</span>. then:</p> <p>H1: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_172\">$\\forall m$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_173\">$P(m\\text{++})\\implies P(m)$</span></p> <p>H2: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_174\">$P(n)\\implies P(m)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_175\">$\\forall$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_176\">$n\\geq m$</span></p> <p>H3: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_177\">$P(n\\text{++})$</span>.</p> <p>In H1, for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_178\">$m=n$</span> we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_179\">$P(n\\text{++})\\implies P(n)$</span> and for H2 we now <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_180\">$P(n)\\implies P(m)$</span> (specifically for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_181\">$n=m$</span>), then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_182\">$P(n\\text{++})\\implies P(m)$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_183\">$n\\text{++}>m$</span>. We need to prove that works for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_184\">$n\\text{++}=m$</span> but for that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_185\">$P(n\\text{++})$</span> is true for H3. We conclude that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_186\">$P(n\\text{++})\\implies P(m)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_187\">$\\forall$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_188\">$n\\text{++}\\geq m$</span>.</p> "
