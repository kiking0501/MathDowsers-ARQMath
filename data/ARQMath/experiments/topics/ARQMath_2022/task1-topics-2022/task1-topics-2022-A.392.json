  "Question": "<p>I am working with polynomials in the ring <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_978\">$\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^n-1)$</span>, so only polynomials with degree at most <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_979\">$n-1$</span> are allowed, and multiplications must be reduced modulo <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_980\">$X^n-1$</span>. The thing is that I have a polynomial <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_981\">$f(X)$</span> and I want to compute its inverse modulo an integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_982\">$p$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_983\">$f_p(X)$</span>, such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_977\">$$ f * f_p \\equiv 1 \\bmod p $$</span> How could I do that? Any known algorithm? I have heard about the extended Euclidean algorithm, but I'm not quite sure how to use it, for example, given <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_984\">$f(X) = -1+X+X^2-X^4+X^6+X^9-X^{10}$</span>.</p> "
