  "Question": "<p>This is<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_496\">$a $</span>somewhat obvious fact that is intuitively obvious to me, but I haven't been able to construct a proof of it. Euclid's lemma states for for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_491\">$p$</span> a prime and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_492\">$ab$</span> a product of integers (let's take everything to be positive for simplicity), if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_493\">$p \\mid ab$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_494\">$p \\mid a$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_495\">$p \\mid b$</span>. This is clear, and I know how to prove it. Let's extend it somewhat. Suppose that <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_497\">$b$</span> are two relatively prime integers, and we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_498\">$a \\mid bc$</span> for some other integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_499\">$c$</span>. Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_500\">$a \\not \\mid b$</span>, so it must divide <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_501\">$c$</span>. This fact is obvious to me, but I can't figure out how to prove it.</p> <p>Does anyone have any hints or advice? Do I need the assumption of positivity? (For my purposes at the moment, I only need them to be positive, but there is value in having the most general result possible).</p> <p>EDIT: Updated attempt:</p> <p>We have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_502\">$a,b$</span> are relatively prime, so there exist <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_503\">$r,s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_504\">$ar + bs = 1$</span> by B\u00e9zout's lemma. Multiply through by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_505\">$c$</span> to get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_506\">$arc + bsc = c$</span>. Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_507\">$a \\mid arc$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_508\">$a \\mid bsc$</span>, so <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_509\">$a \\mid c$</span>.</p> <p>How is that?</p> "
