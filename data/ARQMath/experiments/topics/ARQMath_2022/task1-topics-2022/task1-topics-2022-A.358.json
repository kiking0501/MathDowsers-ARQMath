  "Title": "Confusion about the formula of the area of a surface of revolution",
  "Question": "<p>Before I read the formula of the area of revolution which is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_668\">$\\int 2\\pi y \\,ds$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_669\">$ds = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{dy}{dx}^2}$</span>, I thought of deriving it myself. I tried to apply the same logic used for calculating the volume of revolution (e.g., <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_670\">$\\int \\pi y^2 dx $</span>).</p> <p>My idea is to use many tiny hollow cylinders (inspired from the shell method), each has a surface area of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_671\">$(2\\pi y) (dx)$</span>:</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_672\">$2\\pi y$</span> is the circumference of the cylinder, and</li> <li><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_673\">$dx$</span> is the height of the cylinder</li> </ul> <p>Their product is the surface area of the hollow (e.g., empty from the inside) cylinder.</p> <p>With this logic, the area is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_674\">$\\int 2\\pi y dx$</span>.</p> <p>Where is my mistake? Also it's confusing why for the volume it was enough to partition the object using cylinders and for areas not.</p> "
