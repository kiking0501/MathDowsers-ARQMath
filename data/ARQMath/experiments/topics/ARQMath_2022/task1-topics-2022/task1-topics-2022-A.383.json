  "Question": "<p>For pedagogical purposes, I am looking for an elementary proof (i.e. without resorting to the maximum principle) that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_893\">$f_a(z):=\\frac{z-a}{1-\\overline{a}z}$</span> maps the unit disk into itself when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_894\">$|a|<1$</span>.</p> <p>The usual argument (at least usual for me) is to look at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_895\">$f_a(e^{it})$</span> and check that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_896\">$|f_a(e^{it})|=1$</span>. Then we are done by the maximum principle and the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_897\">$f_a(a)=0$</span>.</p> <p>However, I cannot help but think that there should be an elementary way to do this, using only basic facts about complex numbers such as the triangle inequality. Unfortunately I am running into circles.</p> "
