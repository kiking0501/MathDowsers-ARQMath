  "Title": "Do all arithmetic sequences with coprime coefficients contain a prime?",
  "Question": "<p>Given <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_517\">$a, b \\in Z^+$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_518\">$\\gcd(a, b) = 1$</span>, we can define an arithmetic sequence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_519\">$c_i = a + i \\cdot b$</span>. The sequence is thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_520\">$\\{a, a+b, a+2b, \\cdots\\}$</span>.</p> <p>Do all such sequences contain a prime? Do they contain an infinite number of primes?</p> <p>Example: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_521\">$a=2, b=3$</span>. Then, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_522\">$c_1 = a+b = 5$</span>, which is prime. Meanwhile, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_523\">$a=4, b=2$</span> does not have primes, but <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_524\">$\\gcd(a, b) = 2 \\neq 1$</span>, so this isn't a counterexample.</p> "
