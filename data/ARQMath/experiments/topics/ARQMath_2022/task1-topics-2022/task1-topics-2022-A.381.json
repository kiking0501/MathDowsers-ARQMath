  "Question": "<p>Suppose that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_873\">$A_1, ..., A_n$</span> are countable sets. Show that the cartesian product <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_874\">$A := A_1 \\times ... \\times A_n$</span> is countable.</p> <p>My attempt:</p> <p>Sets are said to be countable if they are finite or if they have the same cardinality as some subset of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_875\">$\\mathbb{N}$</span> (i.e. we can find some bijection <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_876\">$f: A \\rightarrow S$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_877\">$f: S \\rightarrow A$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_878\">$S \\subset \\mathbb{N}$</span>).</p> <p>Assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_879\">$A_1, ..., A_n$</span> are countable sets. Then, there exists bijections <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_880\">$fi: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow A_i$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_881\">$i = 1, ..., n$</span>.</p> <p>Define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_882\">$g: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow A$</span> as follows</p> <p>My issue arises here in finding such a bijective function without it being too complicated. How would I go about finding one? I am also open to any suggestions. Any assistance is welcomed.</p> "
