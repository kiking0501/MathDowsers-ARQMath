  "Question": "<p><strong>Question.</strong> Suppose that all the tangent lines of a regular plane curve pass through some fixed point. Prove that the curve is part of a straight line. Prove the same result if all the normal lines are parallel.</p> <p>I am working on differential geometry from the book by Pressley and I have a doubt in the solution of the above question whose (brief) solution is given by:</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We can assume that the curve <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_480\">$\\gamma$</span> is unit-speed and that the tangent lines all pass through the origin (by applying a translation to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_481\">$\\gamma$</span>). Then, there is a scalar <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_482\">$\\lambda(t)$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_483\">$\\gamma'(t) = \\lambda(t)\\gamma(t)$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_484\">$t$</span>. Then, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_485\">$\\gamma '' = \\lambda'\\gamma   + \\lambda \\gamma' = (\\lambda' + \\lambda^2)\\gamma$</span>.</p> <p>Can anyone please explain me how does this line follow : \" Then, there is a scalar <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_486\">$\\lambda(t)$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_487\">$\\gamma'(t) = \\lambda(t)\\gamma(t)$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_488\">$t$</span>.\"</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> "
