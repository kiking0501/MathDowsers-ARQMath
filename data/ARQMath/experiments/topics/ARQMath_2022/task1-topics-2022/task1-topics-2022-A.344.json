  "Question": "<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Any collection of subsets <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_539\">$\\mathcal{A}$</span> of a nonempty set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_540\">$X$</span> forms the subbasis for a unique topology <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_541\">$\\tau$</span> on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_542\">$X$</span>.</p> <p>This theorem is absolutely amazing to me. I really enjoy the idea of it as a powerful tool, but I have come up with a counterexample that I just can't get over.</p> <p>So the theorem states that <em><strong>any</strong></em> collection of subsets of a nonempty <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_543\">$X$</span> form a subbasis for a unique topology on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_544\">$X$</span>. The emphasis there is <em>any.</em> So, consider the following counterexample:</p> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_545\">$X= \\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$</span> and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_546\">$\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\{a\\}\\}$</span>. Clearly, this is a collection of subsets of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_547\">$X$</span>. Assume that, by our theorem, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_548\">$\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\{a\\}\\}$</span> is a subbasis for some topology on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_549\">$X$</span>.</p> <p>Okay, so since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_550\">$\\mathcal{A}$</span> is a subbasis of some topology on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_551\">$X$</span>, let's try taking intersections of members of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_552\">$\\mathcal{A}$</span>.</p> <p>Well, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_553\">$\\{a\\}\\cap\\{a\\}=\\{a\\}$</span>.</p> <p>Then our basis for our topology is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_554\">$\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\{a\\}\\}$</span></p> <p>This is problematic because this means that our basis <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_555\">$\\mathcal{B}$</span> is just <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_556\">$\\{a\\}$</span>, but note that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_557\">$\\displaystyle\\bigcup \\mathcal{B} = \\{a\\}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_558\">$\\{a\\} \\neq X.$</span> Therefore, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_559\">$X \\not \\in \\tau.$</span></p> <p>How do we get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_560\">$X$</span> in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_561\">$\\tau$</span>? Is my counterexample logically consistent?</p> "
