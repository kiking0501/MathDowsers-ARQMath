  "Title": "How many functions can be used to describe to a finite series?",
  "Question": "<p>I was learning more about series today and would like to know if there are existing proofs I could look at about this problem. Basically, if you are given an infinite series representing a function <em>f</em> : <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_660\">$\\Bbb N \\Rightarrow \\Bbb R$</span> but only shown the first <em>n</em> numbers, how many functions <em>f</em>, written in terms of <em>n</em>, could you write to represent that series. I'm not including piecewise functions, because I assume that would always be infinite.</p> <p>Take the series <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_661\">$(2, 4, ...)$</span> with 2 numbers given. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_662\">$f(n)=2n$</span> , <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_663\">$f(n)=n^2-n+2$</span> , and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_664\">$f(n)=2^n$</span> would all be functions that could fit this series, although they differ after the first two numbers. I believe there are more polynomials that fit this description but I'm not sure how many.</p> <p>My question is, essentially, are there an infinite number of functions for which <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_665\">$f(1) = 2$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_666\">$f(2) = 4$</span>, and if this is the case, does this also apply to any finite number of outputs? (e.g. the first <em>n</em> digits of pi written as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_667\">$(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9...)$</span>) If not, could you find out how many possible functions there are?</p> "
