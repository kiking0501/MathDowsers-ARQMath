  "Question": "<p>How to calculate integral <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_757\">$$J_n=\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{\\sin{(nx)}}{(1+2^n) \\sin{x}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\:?$$</span></p> <p>I tried partial integration but did not succeed in finding a recurrent relation? Also, tried Moivre formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_758\">$I_n+iJ_n$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_759\">$I_n=\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{\\cos{(nx)}}{(1+2^n) \\sin{x}} dx$</span>, but also without success.</p> <p>Any help is welcome. Thanks in advance.</p> "
