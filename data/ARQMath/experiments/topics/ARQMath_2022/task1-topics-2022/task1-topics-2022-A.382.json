  "Title": "Set of functions from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_883\">$SS = \\{ A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3},...\\}$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_884\">$\\{ \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F} \\} $</span> is countable?",
  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_885\">$SS=\\{ A_1,A_2,A_3,\\ldots\\}$</span>, and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_886\">$V = \\{ v \\mid v: SS \\to \\{ \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F} \\} \\}$</span> .Is the set  V countable?  Justify your answer.</p> <p>My instinct is to say that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_887\">$V = \\{ v \\mid v: SS \\to \\{ \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F} \\} \\}$</span> is uncountable, and to prove this using a diagonalization argument, i.e. create a table of values of the functions <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_888\">$v_{1}, v_{2},...$</span> for natural numbers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_889\">$n_1, n_2,\\ldots$</span> and define a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_890\">$v_{m} : SS \\to \\{ \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F} \\}$</span> where it takes all values in the diagonals of the table <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_891\">$T, F$</span> and flips them, and then show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_892\">$v_{m}$</span> cannot appear anywhere in the list. Is my guess correct, and if so would this be a reasonable approach to the problem?</p> "
