  "Question": "<p>While I was going through past Olympiad math papers, I found this question without any explanation. Here is the question:</p> <blockquote> <p>Given a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_103\">$f(x)=\\frac{9^{x}}{9^x+3}$</span>, what is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_104\">$f(\\frac{1}{27})+ f(\\frac{2}{27}) + f(\\frac{3}{27})+ ...+ f(\\frac{26}{27})$</span>?</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer was 13.</p> <p>I took a really bad approach and converted <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_105\">$\\frac{9^{x}}{9^x+3}$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_106\">$1+\\frac{9^{x}}{3}$</span>, which I then noticed was wrong.</p> <p>I also accidentally multiplied <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_107\">$9^{\\frac{1}{27}}$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_108\">$9^{\\frac{2}{27}}$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_109\">$9^{\\frac{2}{27}}$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_110\">$9^{\\frac{3}{27}}$</span>, and so on, before realizing that the functions were added and not multiplied.</p> <p>I suspect that there is something to the power of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_111\">$\\frac{n}{27}$</span>, because 9 is a multiple of 27. However, I am not completely sure.</p> <p>Is there a law that tells me how I can solve this question? Since this is a Math Olympiad question, there is probably a maximum time limit of five minutes to do this question. This means that I probably won\u2019t have time for tedious mathematical calculations with a calculator and online tools, or something like that. Please give me a quick, fast solution that is probably suitable for an 8th grader, at most a solution at a 10th grader level.</p> "
