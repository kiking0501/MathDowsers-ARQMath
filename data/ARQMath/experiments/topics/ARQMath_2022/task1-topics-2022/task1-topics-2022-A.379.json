  "Question": "<p>I'm kinda stuck with this task.</p> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_838\">$G$</span> be a group and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_839\">$ S $</span> the set of all isomorphisms <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_840\">$ f: G \\to G$</span>. I first want to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_841\">$ (S, \\circ) $</span> is also a group.</p> <p>I believe I've shown that all the properties of a group is fulfilled with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_842\">$ (S, \\circ) $</span>:</p> <p>i) Assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_843\">$ x \\in $</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_844\">$ f_1,f_2 \\in S$</span>. Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_845\">$f_2(x) = y \\in G$</span>, since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_846\">$ f_1 $</span> is an ismorphism. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_847\">$ f_2(y) = z \\in G $</span> since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_848\">$ f_2 $</span> is an ismorphism. Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_849\">$ f_1(f_2(x)) = f_1(y) = z = f_1 \\circ f_2(x),$</span> hence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_850\">$f_1, f_2 \\in S \\longrightarrow f_1 \\circ f_2 \\in S.$</span></p> <p>ii) <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_851\">$id$</span> is an isomorphism <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_852\">$ \\longrightarrow id \\in S$</span>.</p> <p>iii) <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_853\">$ f $</span> is an isomorphism <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_854\">$ \\longrightarrow \\exists f^{-1}$</span>, one can show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_855\">$ f^{-1} $</span> is also an isomorphism, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_856\">$ \\longrightarrow f^{-1} \\in S$</span>.</p> <p>Now, assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_857\">$ | S | = 1$</span>, then I want to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_858\">$ G $</span> is abelian and each element has an order of 1 or 2.</p> <p>Im kinda lost with that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_859\">$ | S | = 1 $</span>. If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_860\">$ f \\in S $</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_861\">$f^{-1} \\in S\u00a0$</span> due to previous result, should not <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_862\">$ | S | = 1 $</span> imply that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_863\">$ f = f^{-1} = id$</span>? And how do I move forward from this? Any hints is muy appreciated!</p> "
