  "Question": "<p>Suppose <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_2\">$A$</span> is a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_3\">$m\\times n$</span> matrix.</p> <p>Then Prove that, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_7\">$\\begin{equation*} \\|A\\|_2\\leq \\sqrt{\\|A\\|_1 \\|A\\|_{\\infty}} \\end{equation*}$</span></p> <p>I have proved the following relations: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_8\">$\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\|A\\|_{\\infty}\\leq \\|A\\|_2\\leq\\sqrt{m}\\|A\\|_{\\infty}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\|A\\|_{1}\\leq \\|A\\|_2\\leq\\sqrt{n}\\|A\\|_{1} \\end{align*}$</span> Also I feel that somehow Holder's inequality for the special case when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_4\">$p=1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_5\">$q=\\infty$</span> might be useful.But I couldn't prove that.</p> <p>Edit: I would like to have a prove that do not use the information that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_6\">$\\|A\\|_2=\\sqrt{\\rho(A^TA)}$</span></p> <p>Usage of inequalities like Cauchy Schwartz or Holder is fine.</p> "
