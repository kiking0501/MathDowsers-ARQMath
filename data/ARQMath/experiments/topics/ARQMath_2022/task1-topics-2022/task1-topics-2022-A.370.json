  "Title": "What if we take step functions instead of simple functions in the Lebesgue integral",
  "Question": "<p>When we define the Lebesgue integral, we first define it for simple functions <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_760\">$s(x) = \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n c_j\\chi_{A_j}(x)$</span> (where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_761\">$A_j$</span> are measurable) as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_762\">$\\int sd\\mu = \\sum\\limits_{i=j}^n c_j \\mu(A_j)$</span> and then for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_763\">$f\\ge 0$</span> as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_764\">$\\int fd\\mu = \\sup\\{\\int sd\\mu$</span> : s simple and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_765\">$0\\le s\\le f\\}$</span>. But I was wondering what could go wrong if instead of taking simple functions in the supremum, we would take step functions, i.e. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_766\">$s(x)=\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^nc_i\\chi_{I_j}(x)$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_767\">$I_j$</span> are intervals (any type, like <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_768\">$(a,b), (a,b], [a,b), [a,b])$</span>).</p> "
