  "Title": "How do I calculate the sum of sum of triangular numbers?",
  "Question": "<p>As we know, triangular numbers are a sequence defined by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_276\">$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$</span>. And it's first few terms are <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_277\">$1,3,6,10,15...$</span>. Now I want to calculate the sum of the sum of triangular numbers. Let's define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_273\">$$a_n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_274\">$$b_n=\\sum_{x=1}^na_x$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_275\">$$c_n=\\sum_{x=1}^nb_x$$</span> And I want an explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_278\">$c_n$</span>. After some research, I found the explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_279\">$b_n=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$</span>. Seeing the patterns from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_280\">$a_n$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_281\">$b_n$</span>, I figured the explicit formula for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_282\">$c_n$</span> would be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_283\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_284\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{12}$</span>.</p> <p>Then I tried to plug in those two potential equations,</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_285\">$n=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_286\">$c_n=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_287\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}=1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_288\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{12}=2$</span>. Thus we can know for sure that the second equation is wrong.</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_289\">$n=2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_290\">$c_n=1+4=5$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_291\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}=5$</span>. Seems correct so far.</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_292\">$n=3$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_293\">$c_n=1+4+10=15$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_294\">$\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}=\\frac{360}{24}=15$</span>.</p> <p>Overall, from the terms that I tried, the formula above seems to have worked. However, I cannot prove, or explain, why that is. Can someone prove (or disprove) my result above?</p> "
