  "Title": "Number of non-commutative Lie algebras of dimension 2",
  "Question": "<p>Theorem- Up to isomorphism, the only noncommutative Lie algebra of dimension 2 is that with basis <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_20\">$x , y$</span> and bracket determined by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_21\">$[x,y] = x$</span>.</p> <p>I understand that all vector spaces of dimension 2 over the field <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_22\">$K$</span> are isomorphic to each other. So the number of lie algebras of dimension 2 in a field <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_23\">$K$</span> is determined by the number of possible bilinear operations [ ]<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_24\">$:\\ V \\ X \\ V  \\rightarrow V$</span> satisfying the conditions</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_25\">$a)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_26\">$[x,x]=0$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_27\">$x\\in V$</span></p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_28\">$b)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_29\">$[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_30\">$x,y,z \\in V$</span></p> <p>The bilinear operations on the other hand is determined by the elements to which the pair of base elements are mapped to in the bilinear operation. And since in a lie algebra <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_31\">$[x,x]=[y,y]=0$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_32\">$[x,y]=-[x,y]$</span> we ony need to determine <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_33\">$[x,y]$</span>. Now how do we prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_34\">$[x,y]=x$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_35\">$[y,x]=-x$</span> always and why can't it be [y,x]=y or any other vector ?</p> "
