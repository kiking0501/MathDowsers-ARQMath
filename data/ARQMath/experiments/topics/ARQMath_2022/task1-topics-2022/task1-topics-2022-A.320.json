  "Question": "<p>So my integral is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_242\">$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin^{-1}(x)}{x}$$</span> To avoid confusion let me re-write the integral as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_243\">$$\\mathcal I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arcsin(x)}{x}$$</span> I started off with a trig-substitution that is let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_247\">$x = \\sin(t)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_248\">$t = \\arcsin(x)$</span> which means that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_249\">$dx = \\cos(t) dt$</span> So our integrand becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_244\">$$\\mathcal I = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{t}{\\sin(t)} \\cos(t) dt\\tag{Bounds have changed}$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_245\">$$= \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} t\\space\\cot(t) dt$$</span> Then using Integration by Parts,<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_250\">$\\space$$u = t$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_251\">$\\implies du = dt$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_252\">$dv = \\cot(t)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_253\">$\\implies v = \\ln(\\sin(t))$</span> So our integrand thus becomes, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_254\">$= t\\space\\ln(\\sin(t))$</span> from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_255\">$0$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_256\">$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_246\">$$-\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\ln(sin(t))dt\\tag{t*ln(sin(t)) = 0}$$</span> From here, I don't know how to proceed further. Any help/hint is appreciated :)</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p> "
