  "Title": "How do I show that if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_368\">$A$</span> is compact and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_369\">$U \\supseteq A$</span> is open, then there is an open <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_370\">$V$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_371\">$A \\subseteq V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$</span>?",
  "Question": "<p>This question is from Wayne Patty's Topology Section 5.2.</p> <blockquote> <p>Consider <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_372\">$A$</span> be a compact subset of a regular space and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_373\">$U$</span> be an open set such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_374\">$A\\subseteq U$</span>. Prove that there is an open set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_375\">$V$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_376\">$A \\subseteq  V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_377\">$p \\in A$</span> which implies <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_378\">$p \\in U$</span>. Then a result is given in   the book (Theorem 5.11): A <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_379\">$T_1$</span>-space <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_380\">$(X, \\mathcal T)$</span> is regular if and only if for each member <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_381\">$p$</span> of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_382\">$X$</span> and each neighbourhood <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_383\">$U$</span> of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_384\">$p$</span>, there is a neighbourhood <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_385\">$V$</span> of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_386\">$p$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_387\">$\\overline{V}\\subseteq U$</span>. So, I got <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_388\">$ V \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq U$</span>.</p> <p>But I am unable to prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_389\">$A\\subseteq V \\subseteq \\overline{V}$</span>. I thought that I should let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_390\">$V\\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq A$</span> but I am not able to find a contradiction.</p> <p>Can you please help with that?</p> "
