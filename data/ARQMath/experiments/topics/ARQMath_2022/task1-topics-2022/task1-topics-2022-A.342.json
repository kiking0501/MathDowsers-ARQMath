  "Title": "Four students are giving presentations",
  "Question": "<p>In four sections of a course, running (independently) in parallel, there are four students giving presentations that are each Exponential in length, with expected value of<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_527\">$10 $</span>minutes each. How much time do we expect to be needed until all four of the presentations are completed?</p> <p>I'm a little thrown off by this question since it's in the chapter of order statistics in my book. But I believe that this is just gamma distribution. If each student has expected value of <span class=\"math-container\">$10$</span> minutes each. Shouldn't the time needed till all four of the presentations are completed be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_528\">$40$</span> minutes? <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_529\">$(10 \\cdot 4 = 40)$</span></p> <p>Or is it the following. Calculate the density of the fourth order statistics <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_525\">$$f(x_4) =\\frac{2}{5}e^{\\frac{-x}{10}}\\left(1-e^{\\frac{-x}{10}}\\right)^3.$$</span> Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_526\">$$E(X_4) = \\int_0^\\infty\\frac{2x}{5}e^\\frac{-x}{10}\\left(1-e^\\frac{-x}{10}\\right)^3 \\,dx= 125/6.$$</span></p> <p>So is the answer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_530\">$40$</span> minutes or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_531\">$125/6$</span> minutes?</p> <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p> "
