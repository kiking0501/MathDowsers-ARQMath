  "Question": "<p>I've tried a lot with the Euclidean Algorithm, but I still can't figure it out. Do you know how I can use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_297\">$\\overline{x^2 -x}$</span> in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_298\">$(\\mathbb{R} [x]/(x^4 + 1))^*$</span>?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> "
