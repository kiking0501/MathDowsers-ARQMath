  "Question": "<p>Show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_798\">$\\sqrt n$</span> is irrational if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_799\">$n$</span> is not<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_804\">$a $</span>perfect square, using the method of infinite descent.</p> <p>I know how to prove this by doing a contradiction proof and using The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, but now I'm asked to use infinite descent to prove it. Then the very next problem says \"Why does the method of the text fail to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_800\">$\\sqrt n$</span> is irrational if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_801\">$n$</span> is a perfect square?\" I'm confused by this. Any hints or solutions are greatly appreciated.</p> <p>I was thinking of the standard argument, let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_802\">$\\sqrt n = {a\\over b}$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_803\">$gcd(a,b)=1$</span> and then through some algebra arrive at a common factor for both <span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_805\">$b$</span> which contradicts the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_806\">$gcd(a,b)=1$</span> and so we can apply this over and over again, but then I don't understand how the next problem says to explain why this method fails.</p> "
