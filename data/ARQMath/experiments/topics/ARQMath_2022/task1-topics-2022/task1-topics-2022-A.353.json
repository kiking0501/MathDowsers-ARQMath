  "Title": "Can someone explain why if two random variables, X and Y, are uncorrelated, it does not necessarily mean they are independent?",
  "Question": "<p>I understand that two independent random variables are by definition uncorrelated as their covariance is equivalent to 0:</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_627\">$Cov(x,y) = E(xy)- E(x)E(y)$</span></p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_628\">$E(x)*E(y) = E(xy)$</span>, when x and y are two random independent variables.</p> <p>Therefore, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_629\">$Cov(x,y) = 0$</span>.</p> <p>However, I am having trouble understanding if two random variables, X and Y, are uncorrelated, it does not necessarily mean they are independent.</p> <p>Could someone also give me a real world example of when two random variables are neither independent nor casually connected?</p> <p>I believe it will help me understand this concept better.</p> "
