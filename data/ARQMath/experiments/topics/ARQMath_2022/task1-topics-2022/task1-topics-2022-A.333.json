  "Question": "<p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_448\">$( X, Y)$</span> have a bivariate normal density centered at the origin with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_449\">$E(X^2)$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_450\">$E(Y^2) = 1$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_451\">$E(XY) = p$</span> . In polar coordinates <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_452\">$(X, Y)$</span> becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_453\">$(R,\\Phi)$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_454\">$R^2 = X^2 + Y^2$</span>. Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_455\">$\\Phi$</span> has a density given by</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_447\">$$\\frac{\\sqrt{1-p^2}}{2\\pi(1-2p\\sin(\\varphi)\\cos(\\varphi))}$$</span> And is uniformly distributed iff <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_456\">$p = 0$</span>. (To this point everything is clear)</p> <p>what i do not understand is how to conclude that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_457\">$P\\{XY > 0\\} =  \\frac{1}{2} +\\pi^{-1} \\arcsin (p)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_458\">$P\\{XY < 0\\}= \\pi^{-1} \\arccos (p)$</span>.</p> "
