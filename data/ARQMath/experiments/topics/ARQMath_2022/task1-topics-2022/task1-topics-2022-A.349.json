  "Title": "Inverse to Stirling's Approximation",
  "Question": "<p>The equation for Stirling's Approximation is the following:</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_583\">$$x! = \\sqrt{2\\pi x} * (\\frac{x}{e})^x$$</span></p> <p>Writing as a function for y gives us the following:</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_584\">$$y = \\sqrt{2\\pi x} * (\\frac{x}{e})^x$$</span></p> <p>Is there a way to solve this equation for x, effectively finding an inverse to this function?</p> "
