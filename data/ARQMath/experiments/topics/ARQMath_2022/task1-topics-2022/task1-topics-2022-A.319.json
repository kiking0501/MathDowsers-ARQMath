  "Title": "A wrong argument for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_217\">$\\mathbb{R}$</span> being countable",
  "Question": "<p>We assume <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_219\">$A$</span> is the set of all countable subsets of the set of real numbers. We know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_220\">$A$</span> is a partially ordered set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_221\">$(A, \\subseteq)$</span>.</p> <p>Suppose <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_218\">$$A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq A_n \\subseteq A_{n+1} \\subseteq \\ldots$$</span> is a chain in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_222\">$A$</span>. We can prove <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_223\">$B=\\bigcup_{n \\in \\Bbb{N}} A_n$</span> is a countable set.</p> <p>For each natural number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_224\">$m$</span>, we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_225\">$A_m \\subseteq B$</span>. So <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_226\">$B$</span> is an upper bound for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_227\">$A$</span>. This shows each chain in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_228\">$A$</span> has an upper bound according to Zorn's lemma. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_229\">$A$</span> has a maximal element <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_230\">$X$</span>, and we know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_231\">$X$</span> is a countable set. Now we prove <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_232\">$X = \\Bbb{R}$</span>.</p> <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_233\">$X \\neq \\Bbb{R}$</span>, then there is an <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_234\">$x \\in \\Bbb{R}$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_235\">$x \\notin X$</span>. Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_236\">$Y=X \\cup \\{x\\}$</span>. It's obvious that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_237\">$Y$</span> is a countable subset of the real numbers and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_238\">$X \\subsetneq Y$</span>. This contradicts <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_239\">$X$</span> being a maximal element.</p> <p>Thus, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_240\">$X = \\Bbb{R}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_241\">$\\Bbb{R}$</span> is a countable set.</p> <p>What is wrong with this argument?</p> "
