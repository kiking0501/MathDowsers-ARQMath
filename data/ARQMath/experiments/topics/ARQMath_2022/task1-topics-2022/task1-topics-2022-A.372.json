  "Title": "When did we move from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_783\">$\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{d}\\right]$</span> to the ring of integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_784\">$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}\\left[\\sqrt{d}\\right]}$</span> and why?",
  "Question": "<p>Gauss made great progress in number theory in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_785\">$\\mathbb{Z}$</span> by working in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_786\">$\\mathbb{Z}[i]$</span> (or equivalently <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_787\">$\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{-1}\\right]$</span>), so much so that we call <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_788\">$\\mathbb{Z}[i]$</span> the Gaussian integers now. And it was even known to the old mathematicians that solutions to Pell's equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_789\">$x^2 - dy^2 = 1$</span> could be better analysed by working in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_790\">$\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{d}\\right]$</span>.</p> <p>But now in modern number theory we study much more the ring of integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_791\">$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}\\left[\\sqrt{d}\\right]}$</span>. I find this confusing, as if we want to study Pell's equation with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_792\">$d = 5$</span>, we have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_793\">$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}\\left[\\sqrt{5}\\right]} = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right]$</span> instead of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_794\">$\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{5}\\right]$</span>, which is not what we need. I was under the assumption that modern number theory usually tries to generalise its techniques but I don't see how this is a sensible generalisation and I don't see why the ring of integers is any more useful than just plain old <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_795\">$\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\sqrt{d}\\right]$</span>. So my question is:</p> <p>Why is the ring of integers defined the way it is?</p> "
