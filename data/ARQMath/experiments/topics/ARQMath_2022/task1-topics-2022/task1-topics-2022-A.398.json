  "Question": "<p>Is a continuous function differentiable at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1036\">$x=c$</span> if the limit of its derivative has a value at that point? That is, if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1035\">$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f'(x) = L = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow c^+} f'(x) =\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c^-} f'(x)$$</span></p> <p>Intuitively, the slopes of the tangents approach the same value and since the function is continuous a jump-discontinuity isn't possible so it appears the slope at the point should be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1037\">$L$</span> too. However, I cannot seem to locate such a theorem, so I suspect my intuition is wrong. Is it?</p> "
