  "Question": "<blockquote> <p>Find all monic complex polynomials <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_809\">$P(x)$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_810\">$P(x)|P(x^2)$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p>My progress so far is that I have find that for degree 1, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_811\">$P(x)=x, x^2$</span> are the only ones.</p> <p>For degree 2, they are <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_812\">$P(x)=x^2+x+1, x^2, x^2-1, x^2-x, x^2-2x+1$</span>.</p> <p>I also prove that these are only solutions for degree 1 and 2. However I do not see how this generalizes. Any help please?</p> "
