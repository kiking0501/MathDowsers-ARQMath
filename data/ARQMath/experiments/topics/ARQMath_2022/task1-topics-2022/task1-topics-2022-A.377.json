  "Title": "What is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_815\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\\mathbb{R}^n$</span>?",
  "Question": "<p>In C.H. Edwards's <a href=\"https://store.doverpublications.com/0486683362.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Advanced Calculus of Several Variables</a> he defines the ordinate set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_818\">$\\mathcal{O}_f$</span> of a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_819\">$f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$</span> as the set of points between <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_820\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span> and the graph of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_821\">$f,$</span> including the points of evaluation, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_822\">$\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$</span> and the points in the graph <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_823\">$\\left\\{\\mathbf{x},f\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</span>.  Later on he defines a set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_824\">$\\hat{\\mathcal{G}}=\\partial\\mathcal{O}_f-\\mathbb{R}^n,$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_825\">$\\partial\\mathcal{O}_f$</span> is the boundary of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_826\">$\\mathcal{O}_f.$</span>  The intent seems clear.  First</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_816\">$$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\\mathbb{R}^n=\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\left(\\mathbb{R}-\\left\\{0\\right\\}\\right)$$</span></p> <p>where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_827\">$\\times$</span> means Cartesian product.  Then</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_817\">$$\\hat{\\mathcal{G}}=\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\\mathbb{R}^n\\right)\\cap\\partial\\mathcal{O}_f.$$</span></p> <p>But long ago I learned that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_828\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span> is the set of all real number n-tuples, and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_829\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</span> is the set of all (n+1)-tuples, so elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_830\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n}$</span> are not elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_831\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_832\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n}$</span> is not a subset of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_833\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}.$</span></p> <p>So am I correct in concluding that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_834\">$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\\mathbb{R}^n$</span> is not really the relative complement of the two sets?</p> "
