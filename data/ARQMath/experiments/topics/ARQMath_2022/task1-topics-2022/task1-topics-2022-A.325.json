  "Question": "<p>How to find 100 consecutive composite numbers? After many attempts I arrived at the conclusion that to find <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_302\">$m$</span> consecutive composite numbers we can use this</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_303\">$n!+2, n! +3, ..., n! + n$</span></p> <p>where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_304\">$n! + 2$</span> is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_305\">$2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_306\">$n! + 3$</span> is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_307\">$3$</span> and so on...</p> <p>and where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_308\">$m$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_309\">$n-1$</span></p> <p>Thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_310\">$n!+2, n! +3, ..., n! + n$</span> tells that there are <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_311\">$(n-1)$</span> consecutive numbers. However, there seems to be some gaps or incompetence. For example: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_312\">$4!+2, 4! +3, 4! +4$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_313\">$\u2192$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_314\">$26, 27, 28$</span>.</p> <p>Although it's right there are for sure smaller numbers such as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_315\">$8, 9, 10$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_316\">$14, 15 ,16.$</span> Is there another method for solving such a problem mathematically? Is it a correct method or have I misunderstood it?</p> "
