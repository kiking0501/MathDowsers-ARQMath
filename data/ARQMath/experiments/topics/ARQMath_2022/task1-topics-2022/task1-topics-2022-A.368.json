  "Question": "<p>In <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2315627\">this answer</a> it is stated that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_750\">$$ \\sum_{n\\geq1}\\frac{1}{n^2}=\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac1{n^2}+\\mathcal O(1/x). $$</span> Is this statement true as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_753\">$x\\to\\infty$</span>?</p> <p>What I've done: If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_754\">$x$</span> is fixed, then I think the answer is almost trivial, because we may set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_755\">$C=\\pi^2x/6$</span>, so <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_751\">$$ \\sum_{n=x}^\\infty\\frac1{n^2}\\leq\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac1{n^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}=\\frac{C}{x}, $$</span> therefore <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_752\">$$ \\sum_{n\\geq1}\\frac1{n^2}=\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac{1}{n^2}+\\sum_{n=x}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2}\\leq\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac{1}{n^2}+C/x=\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac{1}{n^2}+\\mathcal O(1/x). $$</span> But is there a constant independent of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_756\">$x$</span> that makes this true?</p> "
