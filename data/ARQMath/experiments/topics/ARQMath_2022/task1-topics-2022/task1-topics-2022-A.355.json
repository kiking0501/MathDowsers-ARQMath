  "Question": "<blockquote> <p>Find all functions <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_640\">$f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_639\">$$f(f(x)^2+f(y))=xf(x)+y$$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_641\">$x,y\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is my approach to the problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>We see that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_642\">$f(x)=x$</span> is an obvious solution (Just trying easy linear equations). I think this would be the only solution to the problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>Am I right? And how to prove that there is no other solution? (<strong>Note:</strong> I am a beginner at functional equations)</p> "
