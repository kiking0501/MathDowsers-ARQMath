  "Title": "If the limit does not converge, can the sum? Or, how could the sum converge?",
  "Question": "<p>Alright, I thought I had seen everything but last night I saw this identity (`twas attributed to Ramanujan),</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1030\">$$ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\cdots = -\\frac{1}{12} $$</span></p> <p>Then I saw a proof that was seemingly correct. So alright, I believe it, hey it is no crazier than having infinities of different sizes and I finally have some closure with that fact. But then, I recalled the benchmark induction proof everyone learns,</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1031\">$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$</span></p> <p>Then kicks in the remains of all those calculus courses I once took, making me thing that, hey wait! We have this,</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1032\">$$ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\infty $$</span></p> <p>I think in this case we said the limit does not exist or the function diverges (correct me if I am wrong!) But... but... according to the identity above,</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1033\">$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n=\\infty} i = -\\frac{1}{12} $$</span></p> <p>But then shouldn't,</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1034\">$$ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\stackrel{?}{=} -\\frac{1}{12} $$</span></p> <p>So what I am seeing here is that even if the limit does not converge, the sum does. Also, a long time ago I remember being told that the sum of two positive integers is always positive. Furthermore, addition is suppose to be closed under integers right? Here we not only have a negative number as a result of the sum of positive integers but a negative non-integer at that.</p> "
