  "Question": "<p>I have a set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_564\">$$ \\{ r \\in \\mathbb Q \\mid r^2 >2, r>0 \\}$$</span> I was wondering why it does not have the greatest lower bound. Isn't <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_565\">$0 \\in \\mathbb Q$</span> a greatest lower bound for this set in rational numbers?</p> "
