  "Title": "I have the following problem: Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_510\">$|x_{n+1} - x_n| < 1/3^n$</span>. Show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_511\">$(x_n)$</span> is a Cauchy sequence.",
  "Question": "<p>We have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_513\">$(x_n)$</span> is a sequence of real numbers. And the relation on the title: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_512\">$$ |x_{n+1} - x_n| < \\frac{1}{3^n}. $$</span> We must prove that this is a Cauchy sequence.</p> <p>I know that an Cauchy sequence follows the definition:</p> <p>given <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_514\">$\\epsilon>0$</span>, exists <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_515\">$n_0 > 0$</span>, such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_516\">$m,n > n_o \\Rightarrow |x_m - x_n|< \\epsilon$</span></p> <p>But I don't know how to use both informations to prove the exercise.</p> <p>If someone please may help me, I'd be very thankful.</p> "
