  "Question": "<p>Is there an easy proof that a non-orientable real surface <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_38\">$X$</span> does not admit a quasi-complex structure?</p> <p>The proof I know is to observe that any quasi-complex structure on a real surface <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_39\">$X$</span> necessarily satisfies the integrability condition <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_37\">$$[T_X^{0,1}, T_X^{0,1}] \\subset T_X^{0,1}$$</span> of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_40\">$T_X^{0,1}$</span> is a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_41\">$1$</span>-dimensional complex vector bundle, and the bracket <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_42\">$[-,-]$</span> is alternating, i.e. it vanishes on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_43\">$T_X^{0,1}$</span>. So by the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_44\">$X$</span> admits a complex structure, and complex manifolds have to be orientable.</p> <p>However, the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem is a deep theorem and feels a bit overkill. Also I don't really <em>see</em> why there cannot be a quasi-complex structure. Is there a more elementary proof to convince myself?</p> "
