  "Question": "<p>The function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_397\">$f(x)=4^x+6^x-9^x$</span> is such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_398\">$f(0)=1>0, f(1)=1>0, f(2)=-29$</span> and next <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_399\">$g(x)=(4/9)^x+(6/9)^x-1 \\implies f'(x)<0$</span> for all real values of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_400\">$x$</span>. So <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_401\">$g(x)$</span> being monotonic the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_396\">$$4^x+6^x=9^x$$</span> has exactly one real solution. The question is whether this real root can be found analytically by hand.</p> "
