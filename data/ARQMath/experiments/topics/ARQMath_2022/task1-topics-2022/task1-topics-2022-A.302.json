  "Title": "<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_9\">$n$</span>-th root of a complex number",
  "Question": "<p>I am confused about the following problem. With <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_11\">$w=se^{i{\\phi}}$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_12\">$s\\ge 0$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_13\">$\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$</span>, solve the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_14\">$z^n=w$</span> in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_15\">$\\mathbb{C}$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_16\">$n$</span> is a natural number. How many solutions are there?</p> <p>Now my approach is simply taking the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_17\">$n$</span>-th root which gives</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_10\">$$z=\\sqrt[n]{s}e^{\\frac{i\\varphi}{n}}$$</span></p> <p>However, it seems that this problem is asking us to show the existance of the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_18\">$n$</span>-th root. Can I assume that the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_19\">$n$</span>-th root of a complex number already exists? Moreoover, would I be correct to say that there is only one solution which is given above?</p> "
