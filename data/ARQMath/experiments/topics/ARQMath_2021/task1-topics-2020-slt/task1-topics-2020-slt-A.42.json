  "Question": "<p>I'm trying to teach middle schoolers about the emergence of complex numbers and I want to motivate this organically. By this, I mean some sort of real world problem that people were trying to solve that led them to realize that we needed to extend the real numbers to the complex. </p> <p>For instance, the Greeks were forced to recognize irrational numbers not for pure mathematical reasons, but because the length of the diagonal of a square with unit length really is irrational, and this is the kind of geometrical situation they were already dealing with. What similar situation would lead to complex numbers in terms that kids could appreciate?</p> <p>I could just say, try to solve the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_337\"><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <math alttext=\"x^{2}+1=0\" display=\"block\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mrow> <msup> <mi>x</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <mo>+</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0</mn> </mrow> </math></span>, but that's not something from the physical world. I could also give an abstract sort of answer, like that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_338\"><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <math alttext=\"\\sqrt{-1}\" display=\"block\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msqrt> <mrow> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msqrt> </math></span> is just an object that we <em>define</em> to have certain properties that turn out to be consistent and important, but I think that won't be entirely satisfying to kids either.</p>",
