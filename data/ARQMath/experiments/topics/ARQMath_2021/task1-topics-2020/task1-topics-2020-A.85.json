  "Question": "<p>A bug starts at time <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_832\">$0$</span> at position <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_833\">$0$</span>. At each step, the bug either moves to the right by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_834\">$1$</span> step <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_835\">$(+1)$</span> with probability <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_836\">$1/2$</span>, or returns to the origin with probability <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_837\">$1/2$</span>. What is the expected number of steps for this bug to reach position <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_838\">$N$</span>?</p>  <p>I tried to first find the possibility that this bug reaches <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_839\">$N$</span> as the number of steps goes to infinity. The recurrence equation I find is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_840\">$$p_n = \\frac{1}{2}p_{n-1}$$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_841\">$p_n$</span> is the possibility for the bug starting at position <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_842\">$n$</span> to reach <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_843\">$N$</span>. We also have the boundary condition <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_844\">$p_N = 1$</span>. Then we see that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_845\">$p_{N-1}=2$</span>, and that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_846\">$p_0 = 2^N$</span>, which doesn't make sense at all because it is greater than <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_847\">$1$</span>. I think I should sort out the value of probability first, and think about the number of expected steps later.</p>  <p>I'm sure there is something wrong with the recurrence equation, but what's wrong about it?</p>",
