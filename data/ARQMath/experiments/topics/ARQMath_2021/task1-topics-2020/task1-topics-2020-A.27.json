  "Question": "<p>When solving for the value, we know that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_208\">$e^{\\pi i}=-1$</span> . I am confused as to what is the right answer when you evaluate this.I am getting two possible answers: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_209\">$e^{3\\pi i/2}$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_210\">$(e^{\\pi i})^{3/2}$</span> so this could be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_211\">$(\\sqrt{-1})^3=i^3=-i$</span> or it could be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_212\">$\\sqrt{(-1)^3}=\\sqrt{-1}=i$</span>. Which one is the correct answer, and where am I going wrong? Thanks.</p>",
