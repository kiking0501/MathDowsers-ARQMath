  "Question": "<p>I just learned about cardinality in my discrete class a few days ago, and this is in the homework. This is all fairly confusing to me, and I'm not entirely sure where to even start. Here's the full question:</p>  <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_559\">$\\mathbb{Q}$</span> denote the set of rational numbers and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_560\">$\\mathbb{Z}$</span> denote the set of integers. Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_561\">$|\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{Z}|$</span>.</p>  <p>I thought about saying that every element in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_562\">$\\mathbb{Q}$</span> can be written as some element in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_563\">$\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$</span>, but I still don't know how to prove that that is a bijection, or even how to prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_564\">$|\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}| = |\\mathbb{Z}|$</span>.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
