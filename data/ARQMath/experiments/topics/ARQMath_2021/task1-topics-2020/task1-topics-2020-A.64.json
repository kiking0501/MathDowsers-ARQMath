  "Question": "<p>Suppose that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_573\">$f : [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$</span> is continuous and that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_574\">$f([a, b]) \\subset [a, b]$</span>. Prove that there exists a point <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_575\">$c \\in [a, b]$</span> satisfying <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_576\">$f(c) = c$</span>. </p>  <p>(If either <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_577\">$f(a) = a$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_578\">$f(b) = b$</span> there is nothing left to show, so you might as well assume that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_579\">$f(a) = a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_580\">$f(b) = b$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_581\">$f$</span> takes its values in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_582\">$[a, b]$</span> this is the same as assuming that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_583\">$f(a) &gt; a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_584\">$f(b) &lt; b$</span>.)</p>  <p>So far, I have:</p>  <p>Pf. Assume <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_585\">$f(a)&gt;a$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_586\">$f(b)&lt; b$</span>.  Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_587\">$x, y \\in [a,b]$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_588\">$f(a)=x$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_589\">$f(b)=y$</span> which means <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_590\">$f[a,b]=[x,y]$</span>. Notice <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_591\">$[x,y]\\subset [a, b]$</span>. Since f is continuous on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_592\">$[x,y]$</span>, there exists some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_593\">$c \\in [a,b]$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_594\">$x$</span> is less than or equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_595\">$c$</span> is less than or equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_596\">$y$</span>...</p>  <p>This is where I am stuck because I don't think I can just assume by Intermediate Value Theorem that some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_597\">$f(c)=c$</span>?</p>",
