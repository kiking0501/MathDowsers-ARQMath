  "Question": "<blockquote>   <p>A family has two children. Given that one of the children is a boy, what is the probability that both children are boys?</p> </blockquote>  <p>I was doing this question using conditional probability formula. </p>  <p>Suppose, (1) is the event, that the first child is a boy, and (2) is the event that the second child is a boy.</p>  <p>Then the probability of the second child to be boy given that first child is a boys by formula, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_24\">$P((2)|(1))=\\frac{P((2) \\cap (1))}{P((1))}=\\frac{P((2))P((1))}{P((1))} = P((2))$</span> ...since second child to be boy doesn't depend on first child and vice versa. Please provide the detailed solution and correct me if I am wrong. </p>",
