  "Question": "<p>I came across an exercise in which we are asked to prove the identity:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_454\">$${2n\\choose n}=\\sum_{k=0}^n{n\\choose k}^2$$</span></p>  <p>The exercise gives the hint:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_455\">$$\\left(1+x\\right)^{2n}=\\left[(1+x)^n\\right]^2$$</span></p>  <p>It's not too difficult to use the hint to prove the identity (the expressions in the identity are the coefficients of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_456\">$x^n$</span> in the respective expansions of the expressions in the hint, which of course must be the same number), but I was wondering whether there is a neater <em>equivalent-counting</em> interpretation...</p>  <p>It's clear that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_457\">${2n \\choose n}$</span> is the number of ways in which we can choose half the elements in a set (where this is possible): how can we interpret <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_458\">$\\sum_{k=0}^n{n\\choose k}^2$</span> equivalently?</p>",
