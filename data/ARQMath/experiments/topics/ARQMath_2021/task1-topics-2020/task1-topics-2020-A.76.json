  "Question": "<p>I am solving problems from an old exam (in topology, but I've translated the problem into more algebraic terms). The problem is the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_703\">$a+b\\mathbb{Z}=\\{z\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\mid z = a+bk \\text{ for some  }k\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_704\">$a\\in \\mathbb{Z}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_705\">$b\\in  \\mathbb{Z}-\\{0\\}$</span>. Suppose we have a collection of such sets   <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_706\">$\\{a_i+b_i\\mathbb{Z}\\mid i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$</span>   satisfying:</p>      <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_707\">$$\\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}(a_i+b_i\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$$</span></p>      <p>Show whether it is always possible to extract a finite   <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_708\">$I\\subset \\mathbb{N}$</span> s.t.</p>      <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_709\">$$\\bigcup_{i \\in I}(a_i+b_i\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, I seem to have forgotten a lot of my elementary algebra... Nevertheless, I have attempted something:</p>  <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_710\">$\\{p_k\\}=\\{2,3,5,\\dots\\}$</span> be the set of primes. We can construct: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_711\">$$\\left(\\bigcup_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}(0+p_k\\mathbb{Z})\\right)\\cup (-1+\\ell_1 \\mathbb{Z})\\cup (1+\\ell_2\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$$</span></p>  <p>for some appropriate non-negative integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_712\">$\\ell_1,\\ell_2$</span>. We could for instance pick <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_713\">$\\ell_1=\\ell_2=5$</span>. Suppose there is a finite sub-collection <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_714\">$\\{0+p_{k_j}\\}$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_715\">$j=1,\\dots,n$</span> s.t. </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_716\">$$\\left(\\bigcup_{1\\leq j\\leq n}(0+p_{k_j}\\mathbb{Z})\\right)\\cup (-1+5 \\mathbb{Z})\\cup (1+5\\mathbb{Z})$$</span></p>  <p>Now, assume <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_717\">$p$</span> is some prime s.t. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_718\">$p&gt;\\max\\{p_{k_1},\\dots,p_{k_n}\\}$</span>, then clearly <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_719\">$p\\notin \\bigcup_{1\\leq j\\leq n}(0+p_{k_j}\\mathbb{Z})$</span>. But here I run into a problem. I want <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_720\">$p\\notin(-1+5 \\mathbb{Z})\\cup (1+5\\mathbb{Z})$</span>. That is, I want <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_721\">$5\\nmid p-1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_722\">$5\\nmid p+1$</span>. This is of course possible if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_723\">$p$</span> is a prime with a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_724\">$7$</span> as its last digit. However, this approach means I have to prove that there are infinitely many primes ending on a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_725\">$7$</span>, which seems like a silly thing to prove for a simple problem like this. Surely, there is a nicer way of solving this?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I am particularily interested in a solution not relying on topology, and whether a solution like my attempted solution works.</p>",
