  "Question": "<p>The problem:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Defining <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_950\">$\\sin x$</span> as the leg <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_951\">$b$</span> of a right triangle with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_952\">$\\angle B=x$</span> (in radians) and hypotenuse <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_953\">$1$</span>, prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_954\">$$\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}x=1$$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>(The motivation is to find the derivative of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_955\">$\\sin x$</span> in a elementary, \"pre-Taylor\" and \"pre-series\" context).</p>  <p>I have seen many times a proof that it is based in the fact that the length of the arc <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_956\">$x$</span> satisfies <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_957\">$$\\sin x&lt;x&lt;\\tan x$$</span> or sometimes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_958\">$$\\sin x&lt;x&lt;\\sin x+1-\\cos x$$</span> The lower bound is clear because the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_959\">$\\sin x$</span> is the length of a straight segment and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_960\">$x$</span> is the length of a curved segment with the same endpoints. But I find that the upper bound is based on this intuitive fact:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_961\">$F$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_962\">$G$</span> are two convex subsets of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_963\">$\\Bbb R^2$</span> and   <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_964\">$F\\subset G$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_965\">$|\\partial F|&lt;|\\partial G|$</span>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>(<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_966\">$|\\partial F|$</span> is the length of the boundary of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_967\">$F$</span>).</p>  <p>But I haven't ever seen a proof of that. I tried it myself but I get stuck trying to bound <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_968\">$$\\int_s^t\\sqrt{1+y'(u)^2}du$$</span> provided for example that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_969\">$y''$</span> is negative and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_970\">$y(s)=y(t)$</span>. I realize that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_971\">$y'$</span> can't be bounded (note for example <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_972\">$y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_973\">$-1\\le x\\le 1$</span>).</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>Is it possible to justify the derivative of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_974\">$\\sin x$</span> or the inequality about the lengths of bounds? Is there any calculus text with this approach (or similar) to define trigonometical functions?</p>",
