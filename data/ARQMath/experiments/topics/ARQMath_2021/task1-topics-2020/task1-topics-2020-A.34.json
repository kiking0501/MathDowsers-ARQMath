  "Question": "<p>So... I had the silly idea to extend Knuth's up-arrow notation so that it included zero and negative arrows. It is normally defined as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_268\">$$\\begin{align*} a \\uparrow b &amp; = a^b \\\\ a \\uparrow^n b &amp; = \\underbrace{a \\uparrow^{n - 1} (a \\uparrow^{n - 1} (\\dots(a \\uparrow^{n - 1} a) \\dots ))}_{b\\text{ copies of } a} \\end{align*}$$</span> so, basically the hyperoperation sequence starting from exponentiation. For now, I will only consider <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_269\">$a,b &gt; 0$</span>.</p>  <p>If we try to go backwards from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_270\">$a \\uparrow b$</span>, the \"trivial\" extension (letting down arrows represent negative up arrows, because why the heck not) is: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_271\">$$\\begin{align*} a \\;b &amp; = a \\cdot b \\\\ a \\downarrow b &amp; = a + b \\\\ a \\downarrow \\downarrow b &amp; = \\text{see below} \\end{align*} \\\\ \\vdots$$</span> But I had trouble coming up with an expression for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_272\">$a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$</span>.</p>  <p>Maybe it doesn't exist. Alternatively, maybe there is a way of defining <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_273\">$a \\; b$</span> (zero arrows) such that it does exist. So my question is: <strong>Is there an extension of Knuth's up-arrow notation such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_274\">$a \\downarrow^n b$</span> exists for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_275\">$n \\geq 3$</span>?</strong> <hr> <strong>Edit</strong>: Welp, I messed this question up. I initially thought <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_276\">$a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = a + 1$</span> was correct, but it is actually <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_277\">$b + 1$</span>. So I thought I had an example of an extension when I did not. I have modified the question accordingly.</p>  <p>An extension would define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_278\">$a \\uparrow^n b$</span> for each <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_279\">$n \\leq 0$</span> which satisfies the recursive definition of the notation.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Okay, turns out <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_280\">$a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = b + 1$</span> isn't correct either, as this would imply <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_281\">$a \\downarrow b = a + b - 1$</span>. For example, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_282\">$4 \\downarrow 3 = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 \\downarrow \\downarrow 4) = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 + 1) = (4 + 1) + 1 = 6 = 4 + 3 - 1$</span>. But it is really close; perhaps we need an exception, such as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_283\">$$\\begin{align*} a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = \\begin{cases}b + 1 &amp; \\text{if } a &lt; b \\\\ b + 2 &amp; \\text{if } a = b \\end{cases}\\end{align*}.$$</span> The case <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_284\">$a &gt; b$</span> does not show up when evaluating <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_285\">$a \\downarrow b$</span>, but it will be need to be defined if we try to extend further to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_286\">$a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$</span>. For instance, we could abuse the fact that the case <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_287\">$a &gt; b$</span> is allowed to be anything, and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_288\">$$a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = b + 1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor,$$</span> but finding <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_289\">$a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$</span> may be intractable as a result.</p>",
