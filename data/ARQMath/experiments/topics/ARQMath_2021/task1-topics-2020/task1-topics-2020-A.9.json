  "Question": "<p>I need to write the series </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_52\">$$\\sum_{n=0}^N nx^n$$</span> </p>  <p>in a form that does not involve the summation notation, for example <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_53\">$\\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \\frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$</span>. Does anyone have any idea how to do this? I've attempted multiple ways including using generating functions however no luck</p>",
