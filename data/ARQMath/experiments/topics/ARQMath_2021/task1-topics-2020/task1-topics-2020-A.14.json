  "Question": "<p>I have first-order differential equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_77\">$$y=xy'+ \\frac{1}{2}(y')^{2}$$</span> Maybe, with this someone will find way to solve it <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_78\">$$\\frac{1}{2}y'(2x+y')=y$$</span> I thought I can use <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_79\">$x^2+y=t$</span> for subtitution and when I derivate, I have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_80\">$t'=2x+y'\\\\(t'-2x)t'=2t-2x^2$</span> which is acctualy the same as previous. I don't have idea how to start.. </p>",
