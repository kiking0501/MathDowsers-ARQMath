  "Question": "<p>First of all I'd like to say that I have looked for the answers to my specific question and have not found it in the existing topics.</p>  <p>The question is fairly simple. Say, we need to  prove statement P by the method of contradiction. <strong>Assuming</strong> that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_292\">$\\lnot P$</span> holds, using the list of statements proven earlier to hold or derived by us during the proof, we arrive to P being <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_293\">$true$</span>.</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_294\">$$\\lnot P  \\to A_1 \\to\\ ... \\ \\to A_n \\to P$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_295\">$$\\lnot P  \\to  P \\iff \\lnot(\\lnot P) \\lor P \\iff P $$</span></p>  <p>We can therefore add P to the list of our proven statements, because it was derived. Most of the proofs contain something in the lines of \"<em>the obtained contradiction proves that our initial assumption (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_296\">$\\lnot P$</span>) was wrong</em> and so <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_297\">$P$</span> holds\".</p>  <p>What I don't understand is, if the initial assumption (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_298\">$\\lnot P$</span>) is thus proven to be <em>false</em>, then why can we be sure that anything derived from it holds (in particular, that P holds)? On the other hand, if it cannot be derived then the assumption (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_299\">$\\lnot P$</span>) can in fact be true. </p>  <p>Can someone explain why this type of argument cannot be used?</p>",
