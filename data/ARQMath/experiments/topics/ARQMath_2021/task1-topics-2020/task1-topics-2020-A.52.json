  "Question": "<p>There are two parts I am having trouble getting started.</p>  <p>A. Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_477\">$n_1, n_2,...,n_k\\in\\mathbb{N}$</span> are each at least <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_478\">$2$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_479\">$n=n_1n_2...n_k+1$</span> is not divisible by any numbers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_480\">$n_1, n_2,...,n_k$</span>. </p>  <p>B. Prove that the truth of the negation leads to a contradiction. (Use theorem: For all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_481\">$a,b\\in\\mathbb{N}$</span> there exist a unique quotient <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_482\">$q$</span> and remainder <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_483\">$r$</span> in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_484\">$\\mathbb{Z^+}$</span> such that we have both <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_485\">$a=qb+r$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_486\">$0\\leq r&lt;q$</span>.)</p>  <p>For part A, I started with, given <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_487\">$k\\in\\mathbb{N}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_488\">$n_1, n_2,...,n_k\\geq1$</span>, I'll show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_489\">$\\forall i$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_490\">$n_i \\nmid n=n_1n_2...n_k+1$</span> to set it up, but I'm not sure how to actually go about starting it.</p>  <p>For part B, I know that the negation is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_491\">$\\exists n\\in\\mathbb{N}$</span> s.t. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_492\">$\\forall m\\in\\mathbb{N}$</span> either <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_493\">$m\\leq n$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_494\">$m$</span> is not prime, but again I'm not sure what I should do to start the proof or exactly how to incorporate that theorem.</p>",
