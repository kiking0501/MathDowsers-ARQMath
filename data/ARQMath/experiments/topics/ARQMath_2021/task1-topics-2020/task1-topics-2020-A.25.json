Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_193\">$P(x)=x$</span>, because all the points on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_194\">$y=P(x)$</span> are <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_195\">$y=x$</span>.</p>  <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_196\">$P(0)=2$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_197\">$P(x)=(x^2+1)^2+1$</span> for the same reason.</p>  <p>But when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_198\">$P(0)=3$</span>, we have that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_199\">$\\lim_{x\u2192\u221e}\\log_xP(x)$</span> does not converge into an integer.
