  "Question": "<p>The proof is required to be made through the binomial theorem. I will expose the demonstration I was tought, and forward my questions after exposing it. You'll see question marks like this one <strong>(?-n)</strong> on points I don't quite understand, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_662\">$n$</span> is the numeration of the mark. This are the doubts I have about the demonstration, the which I hope someone can clarify.</p>  <p>Prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_663\">$\\binom{n}{0}^2 + \\binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}^2 = \\binom{2n}{n}$</span>.</p>  <p>We will use the following equality, and call it <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_664\">$P$</span>: </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_665\">$(1+x)^n(1+x)^n=(1+x)^{2n}$</span>    <strong>(?-1)</strong></p>  <p>The result will be proved finding the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_666\">$x^n$</span> coefficient of both terms of this equality <strong>(?-2)</strong>.</p>  <p>According to the binomial theorem, the left-hand side of this equation is the product of two factors, both equal to</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_667\">$\\binom{n}{0}1+\\binom{n}{1}x+...+\\binom{n}{r}x^r+...+\\binom{n}{n}x^n$</span></p>  <p>When both factors multiply, a term on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_668\">$x^n$</span> is obtained when a term of the first factor has some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_669\">$x^i$</span> and the term of the second factor has some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_670\">$x^{n-i}$</span>. Therefor the coefficients of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_671\">$x^n$</span> are</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_672\">$\\binom{n}{0}\\binom{n}{n}+\\binom{n}{1}\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n}{2}\\binom{n}{n-2}+...\\binom{n}{n}\\binom{n}{0}$</span> .</p>  <p>Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_673\">$\\binom{n}{n-r}=\\binom{n}{r}$</span>, the previous summation is equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_674\">$\\binom{n}{0}^2 + \\binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}^2$</span>. So the left hand side of the equation we are asked to proove is a coefficient of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_675\">$x^n$</span>. When we expand the right-hand side of the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_676\">$P$</span>, we find that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_677\">$\\binom{2n}{n}$</span> is a coefficient of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_678\">$x^n$</span>. Therefore <strong>(?-3)</strong> the left-hand side of the equation we were asked to prove is in deed equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_679\">$\\binom{2n}{n}$</span>. In conclussion,</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_680\">$\\binom{n}{0}^2 + \\binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}^2 = \\binom{2n}{n}$</span>.</p>  <p>This was all the demonstration. My doubt one <strong>(?-1)</strong> goes about where the heck does this equation come from? How would I know what equation to come up with if requested to prove a different equality?</p>  <p>Doubt two <strong>(?-2)</strong> goes about why would the solution of the first equation would have anything to do with finding the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_681\">$x^n$</span> coefficients of the one I just made up (see doubt one).</p>  <p>Doubt three <strong>(?-3)</strong> goes about why demonstrating that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_682\">$a$</span> is a coefficient of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_683\">$x^n$</span> on the left hand side of the equation I made up, and that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_684\">$b$</span> is a coefficient of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_685\">$x^n$</span> on the right-hand side of this equation as well, would prove my original equation, the one I was supposed to prove on the first place?</p>  <p>I know there are many doubts here, I hope you guys can help me. Sorry for the long post, it's a long demonstration.</p>",
