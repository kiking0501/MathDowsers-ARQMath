  "Question": "<blockquote>   <p>Given an infinite field <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_902\">$K$</span>, one can prove that any maximal ideal of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_903\">$K[X,Y]$</span> can't be principal. In fact, every non-principal prime ideal is a maximal ideal, and can be generated by two polynomials.</p>      <p>I am wondering whether the same result holds in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_904\">$\\mathbb F_q[X,Y]$</span>. Can we find a principal ideal <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_905\">$I = (P(X,Y))$</span> for some irreducible polynomial <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_906\">$P$</span> that is a maximal ideal ?  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Such a polynomial <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_907\">$P$</span> must have positive degrees in both <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_908\">$X$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_909\">$Y$</span>. Indeed, given an irreducible polynomial <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_910\">$Q(X)$</span> in only one variable, the quotient  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_911\">$$\\mathbb F_q[X,Y]/(Q(X))\\cong (\\mathbb F_q[X]/(Q(X)))[Y]$$</span> is a ring of polynomials over a field and as such, can never be a field.  </p>  <p>Moreover, such a polynomial <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_912\">$P$</span> must have the form  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_913\">$$P(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=0}^n P_i(X)Y^i$$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_914\">$d\\geq 1$</span>, the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_915\">$P_i$</span>'s are polynomials in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_916\">$X$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_917\">$P_n$</span> is a nonzero polynomial that vanishes identically on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_918\">$\\mathbb F_q$</span>, thus <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_919\">$P_n$</span> must be divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_920\">$\\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb F_q} (X-\\alpha)$</span>.<br> Indeed, if there were some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_921\">$\\alpha \\in \\mathbb F_q$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_922\">$P_n(\\alpha) \\not = 0$</span>, then the ideal <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_923\">$I:=(P,X-\\alpha)$</span> would contain <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_924\">$(P)$</span> strictly. If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_925\">$(P)$</span> were to be maximal, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_926\">$I$</span> would be the whole of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_927\">$\\mathbb F_q[X,Y]$</span>. Writing down the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_928\">$1\\in I$</span> and evaluating <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_929\">$X=\\alpha$</span> would leads us to the conclusion <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_930\">$n=\\deg_Y(P)=0$</span>, which is absurd.  </p>  <p>This is all I could infer so far. With respect to the above, I tried looking at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_931\">$P(X,Y) = (X^{p-1}-1)XY - 1$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_932\">$P(X,Y) = (X^{p-1}-1)XY - X - 1$</span> in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_933\">$\\mathbb F_p[X,Y]$</span> for some prime number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_934\">$p$</span> but I have trouble determining whether the quotient is a field or not.  </p>  <p>Would somebody know the answer of the problem, and according to it, give a proof or a counter-example ? Thank you very much in advance.</p>",
