Is the following formula <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_510\">$$ \\exists p\\ \\bigl(\\text{$p$ is prime } \\rightarrow \\forall x  \\text{ ($x$ is prime)}\\bigr)  $$</span> true or false on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_511\">$S$</span>? I know the answer to this question, but what would be the shortest way to arrive to the conclusion using some deduction system?</p>",
