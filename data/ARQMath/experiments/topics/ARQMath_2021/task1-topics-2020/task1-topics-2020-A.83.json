  "Question": "<p>I'm reading through Spivak Ch.22 (Infinite Sequences) right now. He mentioned in the written portion that it's often not a trivial matter to determine the boundedness of sequences. With that in mind, he gave us a sequence to chew on before we learn more about boundedness. That sequence is:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_819\">$$1, 1+\\frac{1}{2}, 1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}, 1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{4}, . . .$$</span></p>  <p>I know that a sequence is bounded above if there is a number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_820\">$M$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_821\">$a_n\\leq M$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_822\">$n$</span>. Any hints here?</p>",
