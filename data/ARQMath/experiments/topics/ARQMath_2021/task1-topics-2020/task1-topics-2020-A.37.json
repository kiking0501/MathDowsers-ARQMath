  "Question": "<p>Are there real-valued functions <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_303\">$f$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_304\">$g$</span> which are neither each other's inverses, the identity, nor linear, yet exhibit the behaviour <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_305\">$$f\\circ g = g \\circ f?$$</span></p>  <p>Examples such as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_306\">$f(x) = 2x$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_307\">$g(x)=3x$</span> are \"trivial\" in this sense. </p>  <p>Moreover, given a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_308\">$f$</span>, can one go about obtaining an example of a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_309\">$g$</span> which commutes with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_310\">$f$</span>? </p>  <p>I suppose this would be similar to fixed point iteration? E.g. if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_311\">$f\\colon\\mathbb R\\smallsetminus\\{1\\}\\to\\mathbb R$</span> is defined by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_312\">$f(x) = 2x/(1-x)$</span>, I would need a function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_313\">$g$</span> such that  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_314\">$$g(x) = f^{-1}\\circ g\\circ f =\\frac{g(\\frac{2x}{1-x})}{2+g(\\frac{2x}{1-x})},$$</span> so maybe choosing an appropriate \"starting function\" <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_315\">$g_0$</span> and finding a fixed point of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_316\">$g_{n+1} \\mapsto f^{-1}\\circ g_n\\circ f$</span> would be a possible strategy, but I can't seem to find a suitable <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_317\">$g_0$</span>.</p>",
