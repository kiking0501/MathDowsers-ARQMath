  "Question": "<p>My PreCalculus teacher recently reviewed the properties of limits with us before our test and stated that <em>any real number divided by infinity equals zero</em>. This got me thinking and I asked them whether a <strong>complex number</strong> (i.e. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_236\">$3+2i$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_237\">$-4i$</span>) <strong>divided by infinity would equal zero</strong>. </p>  <p>This completely stumped them and I was unable to get an answer. After doing some theoretical calculation, knowing that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_238\">$i=\\sqrt{-1}$</span>, I calculated that a complex number such as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_239\">$\\frac{5i}{\\infty}=0$</span> since  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_240\">$$\\frac{5}{\\infty}\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{\\infty} = 0\\cdot 0 = 0,$$</span>  using properties utilized with real numbers that would state that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_241\">$\\frac{5x}{\\infty} = 0$</span> since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_242\">$$\\frac{5}{\\infty}\\cdot \\frac{x}{\\infty} = 0\\cdot 0 = 0.$$</span> Is this theoretical calculation correct or is there more to the concept than this?</p>",
