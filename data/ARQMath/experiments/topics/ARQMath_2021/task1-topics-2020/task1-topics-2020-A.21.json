  "Question": "<p>I'm continuing on my journey learning about modular arithmetic and got confused with this question:</p>  <p>Find the last two digits of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_135\">$9^{9^{9^{\u2026{^9}}}}$</span> (nine 9s). The phi function is supposed to be used in this problem and so far this is what I've got:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_136\">$9^{9^{9^{\u2026{^9}}}} \u2261 x (\\text{mod } 100)$</span> Where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_137\">$0 \u2264 x \u2264 100$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_138\">$9^{9^{9^{\u2026{^9}}}} \\text{ (nine 9s) }= 9^a$</span> In order to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_139\">$9^a (\\text{mod } 100)$</span>, we need to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_140\">$a (\\text{mod } \\phi(100))$</span> As <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_141\">$\\phi(100)= 40$</span>, we get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_142\">$a = b (\\text{mod } 40)$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_143\">$9^{9^{9^{\u2026{^9}}}} \\text{ (eight 9s) }= 9^b$</span> In order to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_144\">$9^b (\\text{mod } 40)$</span>, we need to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_145\">$b (\\text{mod } \\phi(40))$</span> As <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_146\">$\\phi(40)= 16$</span>, we get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_147\">$b = c ( \\text{mod }16)$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_148\">$9^{9^{9^{\u2026{^9}}}}\\text{ (seven 9s) }= 9^c $</span> In order to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_149\">$9^c (mod 16)$</span>, we need to know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_150\">$c (\\text{mod } phi(16))$</span> as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_151\">$\\phi(16)= 8 $</span> we need to find <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_152\">$c (\\text{mod } 8)$</span></p>  <p>As <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_153\">$9 = 1 (\\text{mod } 8)$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_154\">$c = 1 (\\text{mod } 8)$</span></p>  <p>I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere along the way because I'm having a lot of trouble stitching it all back together in order to get a value for the last two digits. Could anyone please help me with this? Thank you!</p>",
