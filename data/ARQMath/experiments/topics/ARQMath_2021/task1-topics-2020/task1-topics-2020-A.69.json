  "Question": "<p>So I was assigned this homework problem: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_637\">$$\\ {s \\choose s} + {s+1 \\choose s} +...+ {n \\choose s} = {n+1 \\choose s+1}$$</span> for all s and all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_638\">$n \\geq s$</span> I've tried to email both my professor and my TA and their explanations seem contradictory. My professor responded saying the statement I need to prove is \"The formula is correct for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_639\">$0 \\leq s \\leq n$</span>.\" Whereas my TA told me I need to use induction on both variables and I'm not sure how to do that. Any help is appreciated!</p>",
