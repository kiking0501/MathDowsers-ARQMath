  "Question": "<p>I was asked to find the greatest common factor of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_117\">$p^4-1$</span> for all primes > 5, First I got the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_118\">$7^4 - 1$</span> which has divisors of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_119\">$2^4* 3 *5*2$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_120\">$11^4 - 1$</span> which has divisors <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_121\">$2^4 *3 * 5*61$</span> which has a GCF of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_122\">$2^4*3*5$</span> I can prove that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_123\">$p^4 - 1$</span> is divisible by 3 and 5 by casework and 8  by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_124\">$(p^2+1)(p-1)(p+1)$</span> are even integers, but I don't know how to prove divisibility of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_125\">$2^4$</span>, I do not want to bash it since we must check about 7 numbers to prove its divisibility by assigning <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_126\">$16n + x$</span> where x &lt;16</p>",
