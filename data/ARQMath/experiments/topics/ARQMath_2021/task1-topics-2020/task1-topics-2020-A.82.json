  "Question": "<p>I know that my reasoning is incorrect, I just don't know where I went wrong. I did discuss this with my Maths teacher, and even she could not find what I did wrong.</p>  <p>Let us begin by assuming a function, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_798\">$f(x)$</span> that is continuous and has an antiderivative in the interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_799\">$[0, 2\\pi]$</span>. Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_800\">$A$</span> be the area under the curve for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_801\">$f(x)$</span> in the interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_802\">$[0, 2\\pi]$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_803\">$A = \\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{f(x)\\space\\mathrm{d}x}$</span></p>  <p>Now there must exist a function, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_804\">$g(x)$</span> such that:  </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_805\">$f(x) = g(x)\\cdot \\cos(x)$</span></p>  <p>Substituting the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_806\">$f(x)$</span>:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_807\">$A = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{g(x)\\cdot \\cos(x)\\space\\mathrm{d}x}$</span></p>  <p>Using t substitution:<br> Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_808\">$t = \\sin(x)$</span><br> Then: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_809\">$\\mathrm{d}t = \\cos(x)\\space\\mathrm{d}x$</span><br> And:  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_810\">$x = \\arcsin(t)$</span></p>  <p>Changing the limits:<br> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_811\">$t = \\sin(x)$</span><br> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_812\">$0$</span> becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_813\">$\\sin(0) = 0$</span><br> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_814\">$2\\pi$</span> becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_815\">$\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$</span></p>  <p>Substituting in the definite integral:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_816\">$A = \\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{0}{g(\\arcsin(t))\\space\\mathrm{d}t}$</span></p>  <p>But Definite Integral where the lower and upper bounds are the same is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_817\">$0$</span>.<br> So:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_818\">$A = 0$</span>, which is not possible.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>",
