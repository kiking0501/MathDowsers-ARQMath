  "Question": "<p>Prove that for a given prime <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_403\">$p$</span> and each <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_404\">$0 &lt; r &lt; p-1$</span>, there exists a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_405\">$q$</span> such that </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_406\">$$rq \\equiv 1 \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>I've only taken one intro number theory course (years ago), and this just popped up in a computer science class (homework). I was assuming that this proof would be elementary since my current class in an algorithm cours, but after the few basic attempts I've tried it didn't look promising. Here's a couple approaches I thought of:</p>  <hr>  <p>(<em>reverse engineer</em>)</p>  <p>To arrive at the conclusion we would need</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_407\">$$rq - 1 = kp$$</span></p>  <p>for some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_408\">$k$</span>. A little manipulation:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_409\">$$qr - kp = 1$$</span></p>  <p>That looks familiar, but I can't see anything from it.</p>  <hr>  <p>(<em>sum on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_410\">$r$</span></em>)</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_411\">$$\\sum_{r=1}^{p-2} r = \\frac{(p-2)(p-1)}{2} = p\\frac{p - 3}{2} + 1 \\equiv 1 \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>which looks good but I don't know how to incorporate <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_412\">$r$</span> int0 the final equality.  </p>  <hr>  <p>(<em>Wilson's Theorem\u2014proved by Lagrange</em>)  </p>  <p>I vaguely recall this theorem, but I was looking at it in an old book and it wasn't easy to see how we arrived there. Anyways, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_413\">$p$</span> is prime <em>iff</em> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_414\">$$(p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>Here the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_415\">$r$</span> multiplier is built in to the factorial expression so I was thinking of adding <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_416\">$2$</span> to either side</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_417\">$$(p-1)! + 2 \\equiv 1 \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>which is a dead end (pretty sure). But then I was thinking, maybe multiplying Wilson't Thm by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_418\">$(p+1)$</span>? Then getting</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_419\">$$(p+1)(p-1)! = -(p+1) \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>which I think results in</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_420\">$$(p+1)(p-1)! = 1 \\bmod p$$</span></p>  <p>of which <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_421\">$r$</span> is a multiple and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_422\">$q$</span> is obvious. But I'm not sure if that's valid.</p>",
