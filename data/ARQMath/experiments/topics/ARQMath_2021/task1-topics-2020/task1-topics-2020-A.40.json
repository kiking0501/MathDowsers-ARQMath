  "Question": "<p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_328\">$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+...+a_nx_n=$</span> is called a linear equation because it represents the equation of a line in an n dimensional space. So \"linear\" comes from the word \"line\".Basically there should not be any higher power of x failing which the graph of the function will not be a straight line.</p>  <p>simillarly</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_329\">$a(x)y+b(x)y'+c(x)y\"+d(x)y'''+...+q(x)=0$</span> is also called linear differential equation because all the derivatives have power equal to 1 which is similar to the above definition of a linear equation.</p>  <p>A function f is called linear if: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_330\">$f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_331\">$f(cx)=cf(x)$</span>. Here c is a constant. In this definition of linearity of function \"<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_332\">$f$</span>\" what does the word linear means? How does it relate to a straight line?</p>  <p>Finally what does the term linear means in case of linear vector spaces? Where is the reference to a straight line?</p>  <p>So, whether linear is just a word used in different contexts? Does it have different meaning in different situation? Or linearity refers to some relation to a straight line? At Least please explain how the linearity of function f and linear vector space relate to the equation of a line.</p>",
