  "Question": "<blockquote>   <p>Show that the relation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_727\">$(- 1) (- 1) =  1$</span> is a consequence of the distributive law.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This question is the first problem from 'Number Theory for Beginners\" by Andre Weil. I cannot get the point from where to begin. I tried using <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_728\">$1\\cdot 1 = 1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_729\">$ 1\\cdot x = x $</span>, but couldn't get somewhere. Can you help me just with a hint? I would be willing to work up from there.</p>",
