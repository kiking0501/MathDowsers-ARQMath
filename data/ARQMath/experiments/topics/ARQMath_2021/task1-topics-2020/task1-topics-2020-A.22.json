  "Question": "<p>I have a challenge about a cat in a trip where he can walk in the way of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_157\">$d, d+1, d+2...$</span> and the sum of that should give <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_158\">$N$</span>, given an <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_159\">$N$</span>, how many ways of chosing <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_160\">$d$</span> are posible?</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_161\">$N=30$</span> -> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_162\">$Ans=3$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_163\">$d_1=4; d_2=6; d_3=8$</span> </p>  <p>For <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_164\">$d_1: 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 30$</span></p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <p>Another way to see it is: How many subsets in the sumation up to N are posible in the way <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_165\">$(\\sum (d+n) - \\sum(d-1))$</span>=N</p>",
