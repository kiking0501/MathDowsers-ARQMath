  "Question": "<p>We know that for a group element <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_495\">$g\\in G$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_496\">$gh=1$</span> does not necessarily mean that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_497\">$hg = 1$</span>. In the case for matrices (linear maps between vector spaces), it is also true that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_498\">$AB = 1 \\nRightarrow BA = 1$</span>. This happens when the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_499\">$A$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_500\">$B$</span> are not square matrices (in which case they do not even form a group under multiplication).</p>  <p>However if we restrict the square matrices, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_501\">$AB = 1 \\Rightarrow BA = 1$</span>. What is simple proof of this that avoids chasing the entries, and makes use simply the vector space structure of linear transformations?</p>  <p>(In fact if we could prove this, I think this might imply that for a group to have one-sided(but not two-sided) inverses, it has to be infinite, since every finite group admits a finite dimensional representation.</p>",
