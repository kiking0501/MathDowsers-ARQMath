  "Question": "<p>Is there a continuous function from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_896\">$\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$</span> that reaches all of its possible values (each value in it's range) exactly <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_897\">$2$</span> times (for example, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_898\">$x^2$</span> would be perfect if it wasn't for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_899\">$0$</span>..). Also, the same question but <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_900\">$3$</span> times.</p>  <p>I'm almost certain that there aren't such functions but who knows haha maybe there are a bunch...</p>",
