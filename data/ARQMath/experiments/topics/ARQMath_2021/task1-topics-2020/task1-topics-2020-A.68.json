  "Question": "<p>Prove <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_620\">$a^n+1$</span> is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_621\">$a + 1$</span> if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_622\">$n$</span> is odd:</p>  <p>We know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_623\">$a$</span> cannot be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_624\">$-1$</span> and the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_625\">$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_626\">$n$</span> must be odd, we can rewrite <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_627\">$n$</span> as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_628\">$2k+1$</span>. Now we assume it holds for prove that it holds for the next term.</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_629\">$$a^{2(k+1)+1}+1$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_630\">$$=a^{2k+3}+1$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_631\">$$=a^3\\cdot a^{2k}+1$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_632\">$$=(a^3+1)\\cdot a^{2k} -a^{2k}+1$$</span></p>  <p>Im not sure on what to do next. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_633\">$a^{2k}$</span> means that the exponential term will be even and thus you cant use the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_634\">$a^n+1$</span> is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_635\">$a + 1$</span> if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_636\">$n$</span> is odd.    </p>",
