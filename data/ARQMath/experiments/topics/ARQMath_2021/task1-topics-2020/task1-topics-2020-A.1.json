  "Question": "<p>I am comfortable when I am asked to calculate the range of a rational function, but how do we do the reverse? I came across this problem.</p>  <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_4\">$$f(x)= \\frac{x^2 + x + c}{x^2 + 2x + c}$$</span> then find the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_5\">$c$</span> for which the range of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_6\">$f(x)$</span> does not contain <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_7\">$[-1, -\\frac{1}{3}]$</span>.</p>",
