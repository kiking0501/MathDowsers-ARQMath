  "Question": "<p>I'm trying to show the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <blockquote>     <p>If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_426\">$x,y \\geq 0$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_427\">$(x+y)^k \\geq x^k + y^k$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_428\">$k \\in \\mathbb{R_{\\geq 1}}$</span></p>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>So, far I've tried a few things, but nothing seems to stick. Clearly <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_429\">$x \\leq x+ y$</span> and since both sides of the inequality are positive, the inequality <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_430\">$x^k \\leq (x + y)^k$</span> will hold for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_431\">$k \\geq 1$</span>. Similarly, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_432\">$y^k \\leq (x+y)^k$</span>. Adding both inequalities together, we obtain: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_433\">$x^k + y^k \\leq 2(x+y)^k$</span>. While this is close, of course, it is not what we want to show.</p>  <p>Alternatively, I was thinking that if we fix <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_434\">$x,y \\geq 0$</span>, let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_435\">$f(k) = (x+y)^k$</span>, and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_436\">$g(k) = x^k + y^k$</span>, we can show using the binomial theorem that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_437\">$(x+y)^r \\geq x^r + y^r$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_438\">$r \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$</span>. Then, if we can show both <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_439\">$f$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_440\">$g$</span> intersect only when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_441\">$k =1 $</span>, we might have better luck proving the statement since then we would have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_442\">$(x+y)^r &gt; x^r + y^r$</span> for all positive integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_443\">$r \\geq 2$</span>. A real number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_444\">$m \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$</span> with the property that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_445\">$f(m) = g(m)$</span> could not then exist since then that would violate the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_446\">$k=1$</span> is the only intersection. We could then invoke the continuity of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_447\">$f$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_448\">$g$</span> together with the fact that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_449\">$(x+y)^r &gt; x^r + y^r$</span> for all positive integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_450\">$r \\geq 2$</span> to obtain our result. Of course, all of this is dependent on rigorously showing that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_451\">$f$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_452\">$g$</span> intersect only when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_453\">$k=1$</span>.</p>  <p>Otherwise, I'm running low on ideas. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
