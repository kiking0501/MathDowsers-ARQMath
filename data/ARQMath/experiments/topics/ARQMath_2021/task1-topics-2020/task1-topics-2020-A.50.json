  "Question": "<p>Bonjour.  Show that  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_460\">$$\\sum{\\frac{1}{n^{2+\\cos{n}}}}$$</span> is a divergent serie. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_461\">$$\\\\$$</span></p>  <p>My main problem is: If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_462\">$\\epsilon$</span> is \u201cinfinitely small positive real number\u201d define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_463\">$A_{\\epsilon}$</span> as the set of all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_464\">$n, |2+\\cos n|\\leq 1+\\epsilon$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_465\">$(n \\in A_{\\epsilon}\\iff-1\\leq \\cos n \\leq -1+\\epsilon)$</span>. The divergence should come from the sum over <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_466\">$A_{\\epsilon}$</span> but I have no idea to how to handle this. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_467\">$$\\\\$$</span></p>",
