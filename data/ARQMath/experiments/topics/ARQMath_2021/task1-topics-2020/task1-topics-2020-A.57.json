  "Question": "<p>I know that given <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_512\">$B$</span>, a compact subset of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_513\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_514\">$f : B \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$</span>, a continuous injective (one-to-one) function, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_515\">$f^{-1}$</span> is continuous on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_516\">$f(B)$</span>. (This true).</p>  <p>I also know that image <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_517\">$f(X)$</span> of a connected subset <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_518\">$X$</span> is connected under a continuous function.</p>  <p>Now let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_519\">$X$</span> be a connected (non-compact) subset of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_520\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_521\">$f : X \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$</span> be a continuous injective (one-to-one) function. I am trying (and struggling) to provide a counterexample in which mapping <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_522\">$f^{-1} : f(X) \\mapsto X$</span> is not continuous on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_523\">$f(X)$</span>. (A rigorous, parametrized example).</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>",
