  "Question": "<p>I want to find</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_25\">$$ 5^{133} \\mod 8. $$</span> I have noticed that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_26\">$5^n \\mod 8 = 5$</span> when <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_27\">$n$</span> is uneven and 1 otherwise, which would lead me to say that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_28\">$5^{133} \\mod 8 = 5$</span> But I don't know how to prove this. How can I prove that this is the case (or find another solution if it is not)?</p>",
