  "Question": "<p>If we look at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_986\">$\\mathbb{C}$</span> as a vector space over <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_987\">$\\mathbb{R}$</span> it's dimension will be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_988\">$2$</span>, because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_989\">$\\mathbb{C} = span\\{1,i\\}$</span>. <br/> A question I thought of is what would be the dimension of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_990\">$\\mathbb{R}$</span> as a vector space over <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_991\">$\\mathbb{Q}$</span>? <br/> I feel like the answer should be infinity, because if the dimension was finite, say <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_992\">$n$</span>, then for every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_993\">$m := n+1$</span> real numbers  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_994\">$x_1,...x_m$</span> there was a linear combination with rational coefficients that gives <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_995\">$0$</span>: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_996\">$\\frac{a_1}{b_1}x_1+...+\\frac{a_m}{b_m}x_m = 0$</span>. Multiplying by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_997\">$lcm(b_1,...,b_m)$</span> we get that for every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_998\">$m$</span> real numbers there is a linear combination with natural coefficients that gives <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_999\">$0$</span>. That feels false, how do you prove it?</p>",
