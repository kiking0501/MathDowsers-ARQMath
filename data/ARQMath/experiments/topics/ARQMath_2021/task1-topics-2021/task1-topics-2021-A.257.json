  "Question": "<p>I was sitting in analysis yesterday and, naturally, we took the limit of some expression. It occurred to me that \"taking the limit\" of some expression abides the rules of a linear transformation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_511\">$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow k}\\ c(f(x)+g(x)) = c \\lim_{x \\rightarrow k} f(x) + c\\ \\lim_{x \\rightarrow k} g(x),$$</span> and (my group theory is virtually non existent) appears also to be a homomorphism: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_512\">$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow k} (fg)(x) = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow k} f(x)g(x), $$</span> etc.</p>  <p>Anyway, my real question is, what mathematical construct <em>is</em> the limit? </p>",
