  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_368\">$R$</span> be a symmetric, transitive relation. If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_369\">$(x, y) \\in R$</span> then the symmetric property implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_370\">$(y, x) \\in R$</span>. Using the the transitive property upon <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_371\">$(x, y)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_372\">$(y, x)$</span> we can conclude <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_373\">$(x, x) \\in R$</span>. Is this fair logic or is it flawed?</p>",
