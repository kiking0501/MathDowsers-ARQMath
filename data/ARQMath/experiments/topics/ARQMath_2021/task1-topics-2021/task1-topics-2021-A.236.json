  "Question": "<p>According to references (e.g. Wikipedia and elsewhere), the Dirichlet distribution, parametrized by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_310\">$\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_K)$</span>, is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_311\">$$ D(x_1, \\ldots, x_K) = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{B}(\\boldsymbol\\alpha)} \\prod_{i=1}^K x_i^{\\alpha_i - 1} $$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_312\">$$ \\mathrm{B}(\\boldsymbol\\alpha) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^K \\Gamma(\\alpha_i)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^K \\alpha_i\\right)}. $$</span> So, if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_313\">$K = 2$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_314\">$\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = 1$</span> then this gives <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_315\">$ D(x_1, x_2) = 1/\\mathrm{B(\\boldsymbol\\alpha)} $</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_316\">$$ \\mathrm{B}(\\boldsymbol\\alpha) = \\Gamma(1)^2 / \\Gamma(2) = 1 $$</span> so, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_317\">$D(x_1, x_2) = 1$</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_318\">$x_1, x_2$</span>.  However, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_319\">$D(x_1, x_2)$</span> is defined on the standard <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_320\">$1$</span>-simplex defined in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_321\">$R^2$</span> by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_322\">$x_i \\ge 0$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_323\">$x_1 + x_2 = 1$</span>.  This is the span (or affine hull) of the two points <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_324\">$(0, 1)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_325\">$(1, 0)$</span>.  Since this is a line segment of length <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_326\">$\\sqrt{2}$</span>, the integral of the Dirichlet distribution over this simplex is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_327\">$\\sqrt{2}$</span>, not <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_328\">$1$</span> as expected.  What am I missing here?</p> <p>The same problem comes in higher dimensions.  For instance, for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_329\">$K=3$</span>, the simplex is a triangle with side <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_330\">$\\sqrt{2}$</span>, but the normalization constant becomes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_331\">$B(\\boldsymbol\\alpha) = 1/\\Gamma(3) = 1/2$</span>, which is not the area of this triangle.</p> <p>What is wrong here?</p>",
