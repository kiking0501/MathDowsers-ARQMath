  "Question": "<p>So I have the two following series: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_780\">$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^n(2k)^2}{(2n+2)!}$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_781\">$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=0}^n(2k+1)^2}{(2n+3)!}$$</span> I figured out the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_782\">$n$</span>th partial products: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_783\">$$\\prod_{k=1}^n(2k)^2=4^n(n!)^2$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_784\">$$\\prod_{k=0}^n (2k+1)^2=\\frac{((2n+1)!)^2}{4^n(n!)^2}$$</span> So putting these back into my series they become the following: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_785\">$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^n(2k)^2}{(2n+2)!}=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{4^n(n!)^2}{(2n+2)!}$$</span> Now this diverges as expected by the limit test test. However when I look at my other series: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_786\">$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=0}^n(2k+1)^2}{(2n+3)!}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{( (2n+1)!)^2}{4^n(n!)^2(2n+3)!}$$</span> By the limit test maybe diverges or maybe doesn't, and the ratio test is inconclusive. Since I wasn't sure what to use for the a comparison test I threw this into wolfram alpha and it told me it converges which is baffling to me since both series are very similar if we write them out: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_787\">$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^n(2k)^2}{(2n+2)!}=\\frac{2^2}{4!}+\\frac{2^24^2}{6!}+\\frac{2^24^26^2}{8!}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_788\">$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\prod_{k=0}^n(2k+1)^2}{(2n+3)!}=\\frac{1^2}{3!}+\\frac{1^23^2}{5!}+\\frac{1^23^25^2}{7!}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot$$</span> They both have the nth parial product of the even/odd integers squared in the numerator, and are over a factorial that is two greater than <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_789\">$n$</span>, so I'm not sure why one is diverging and the other is converging. Is wolframalpha wrong, as it can be at times? Or is there someething here that I am missing?</p>",
