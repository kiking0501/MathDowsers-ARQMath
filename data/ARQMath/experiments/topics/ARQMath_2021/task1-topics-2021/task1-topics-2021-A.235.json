  "Question": "<p>How do I solve the Diophantine equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_303\">$ax^2 + bx + c = y^2$</span>?</p> <p>The approach I have so far is to use the transformation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_304\">$X = 2ax + b$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_305\">$Y = 2y$</span>. Applying this, we get, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_306\">$X^2 - dY^2 = n$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_307\">$n = b^2 - 4ac$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_308\">$d = a$</span>.</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_309\">$X^2 - dY^2 = n$</span> is a Pell equation.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <ol> <li>Is there any other method?</li> <li>What is the complexity of the algorithm for finding the solution to the Pell equation?</li> </ol>",
