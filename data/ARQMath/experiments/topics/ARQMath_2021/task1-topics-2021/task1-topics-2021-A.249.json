  "Question": "<p>I have to show that the following group <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_466\">$$ (G, * , e) $$</span> with its operation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_467\">$*$</span>, which is defined through <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_468\">$ g*g = e$</span>  for every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_469\">$g \\in G $</span> is an abelian group.</p> <p>In order to do that one have only to show that the group is commutative.</p> <p>How can one prove it whereas the operation is defined always between an Element and itself?</p> <p>I reckon it is not so simple as it seems</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help :)</p>",
