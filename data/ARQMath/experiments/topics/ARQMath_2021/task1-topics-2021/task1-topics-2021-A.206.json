  "Question": "<p>Okay so I read Richard Rusczyk's AoPS Volume 2 Book, and I stumbled upon the part where he informs very briefly that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_34\">$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n=e$</span>. But he doesn't really provide a rigorous proof as to why that's true (not criticizing him or anything).. It would really help if someone could provide me with the <strong>simplest</strong> proof possible as to why <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_35\">$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n=e$</span>. Thank you in advance!</p>",
