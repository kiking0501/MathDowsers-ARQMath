However, a significantly more general result holds and seems worthy, of independent address; hence,</p> <p>Let</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_7\">$F \\subset E \\tag 1$</span></p> <p>be fields with</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_8\">$[E:F] < \\infty; \\tag 2$</span></p> <p>if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_9\">$R$</span> is a ring such that</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_10\">$F \\subset R \\subset E, \\tag 3$</span></p> <p>show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_11\">$R$</span> is in fact a field.</p>",
