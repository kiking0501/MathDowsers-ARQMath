  "Question": "<p>So, I'm not a big expert in this subject but I know <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_236\">$1+2+3...=-\\dfrac{1}{12}$</span> isn't to do with 'real' maths but it's all to do with the zeta function; however I was watching a maths video and the equation:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_237\">$$ \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} $$</span></p>  <p>... is actually a perfect equation for the series <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_238\">$1+2+3...$</span> etc. where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_239\">$x$</span> represents <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_240\">$n$</span> in a series and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_241\">$y$</span> is the sum of the series up to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_242\">$n$</span>. So, you can conclude that:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_243\">$$ \\sum^{n}_{i=1}1+2+3...=\\frac{x(x+1)}{2} $$</span></p>  <p>However, this is where it gets weird; as you have probably guessed, the roots of the equation is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_244\">$x=0,-1$</span>  but if I want to find the integral of the roots from <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_245\">$-1$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_246\">$0$</span> which is under the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_247\">$x$</span> axis, I get the following:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_248\">$$ \\int_{-1}^{0} \\frac{x(x+1)}{2}\\:dx=-\\frac{1}{12} $$</span></p>  <p>So, my question is why is this the case; what connection is there between the value of the integral under the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_249\">$x$</span> axis that this graph has compared to the summation of the series?</p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d1k8kx4xuc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link to Desmos graph for more clarity</a></p>",
