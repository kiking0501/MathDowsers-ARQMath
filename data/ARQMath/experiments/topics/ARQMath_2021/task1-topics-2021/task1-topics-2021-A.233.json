  "Question": "<p>I'm revisiting the definition for tangent spaces in Lee's <em>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</em> and I'm trying to convince myself why we might define tangent vectors as derivations at a point <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_282\">$p\\in M$</span>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_283\">$M$</span> be a smooth manifold, and let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_284\">$p\\in M$</span>. A linear map <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_285\">$v:C^\\infty(M)\\to \\mathbb{R}$</span> is called a <strong>derivation at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_286\">$p$</span></strong> if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_287\">\\begin{align*} v(fg) = f(p)vg + g(p)vf \\end{align*}</span> for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_288\">$f,g\\in C^\\infty(M)$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So far, I know that if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_289\">$M=\\mathbb{R}^n$</span>, then each derivation can be given as a directional derivative in some direction in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_290\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span>. After reading the parts on the differential and its computation in coordinates, I'm still wondering why we would be interested in defining a tangent vector as a map that acts on functions on the manifold and the benefits from acting on smooth functions. The main reason that I can think of is that the collection of derivations at a point forms a vector space, which is we what want for a tangent space.</p> <p>I have also looked at the approach of defining tangent vectors with equivalence classes of curves, but it seems that there's also an action on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_291\">$f\\in C^\\infty(M)$</span> going on; we call curves <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_292\">$\\gamma:J\\to M$</span> the tangent vectors, and they have a directional-derivative-like operators that act on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_293\">$f\\in C^\\infty(M)$</span> by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_294\">\\begin{align*} \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}(f\\circ \\gamma)(t)\\right|_{t=0}. \\end{align*}</span> This seems really similar to how a vector in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_295\">$\\mathbb{R}^n$</span> defines its own directional derivative, but again, I'm not sure why the action on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_296\">$f\\in C^\\infty(M)$</span> would be useful/significant.</p>",
