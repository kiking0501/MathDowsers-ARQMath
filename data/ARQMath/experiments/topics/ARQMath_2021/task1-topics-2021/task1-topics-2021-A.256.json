  "Question": "<p>I am learning about limits and there is something that I cant quite understand:</p>  <p>If we have the function:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_507\">$$ f(x) =\\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} $$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>Let's say that we want to see which value for y (image) the function approaches as x (domain) gets closer to 1. On a nutshell, we have to take this following limit:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_508\">$$ \\lim_{x\\to1}\\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} $$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>As soon as we look to this function, we realize that the function is not continuous at x = 1 <strong>(By the way, can I say that?)</strong>. </p>  <p>I know the algorithm to figure out the solution of the limit:</p>  <p>First, there is the need of eliminating the function discontinuity. Usually, it is just a matter of factorizing the function into a new function which the exactly same image as the one before with one crucial difference: <em>The function is continuous for all real numbers</em> </p>  <p>My doubts:Is my way to think about it correct? Can I think like that?</p>  <p>Take the example above:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_509\">$$ f(x) = \\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} $$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>After factorizing, we get:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_510\">$$ f(x) = {x+1} $$</span></p>  <p>If we plot both functions, they are the same, although the second one has its continuity all along the real numbers domain</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>",
