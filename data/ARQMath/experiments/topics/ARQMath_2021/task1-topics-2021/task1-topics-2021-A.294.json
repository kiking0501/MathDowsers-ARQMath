  "Question": "<p>I am looking for a reference to answer the question in the title. Let me try to clarify a little what I mean:</p>  <p>If a single sheaf <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_800\">$\\mathscr F$</span> has a resolution <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_801\">$\\mathscr G^\\bullet$</span> by not necessarily injective objects, then the usual cohomology of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_802\">$\\mathscr F$</span> is isomorphic to the hypercohomology of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_803\">$\\mathscr G^\\bullet$</span>:  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_804\">$$ H^i(X, \\mathscr F) \\cong \\mathbb H^i(X,\\mathscr G^\\bullet). $$</span></p>  <p>Now, if one was starting with a complex of sheaves <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_805\">$\\mathscr F^\\bullet$</span> and a \"resolution\" thereof, i.e. a complex of complexes <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_806\">$(\\mathscr G^\\bullet)^\\bullet$</span>, then one should touch on a concept that could be called hyper-hypercohomology. </p>  <p>Yet, I never heard of its existence and I'm pretty sure it does not give you anything new, as soon as you work in the derived category. I just find myself unable to pin down why exactly this is the case. </p>  <p>Any ideas anyone?</p>",
