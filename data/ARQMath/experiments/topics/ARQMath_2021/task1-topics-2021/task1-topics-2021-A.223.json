  "Question": "<blockquote> <p>Give a combinatorial proof that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_177\">$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^n {n+i\\choose i}\\frac{1}{2^i} = 2^n$</span>.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure if Pascal's identity is useful here. Or perhaps there is a way involving binary strings? <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_178\">$2^n$</span> is the number of binary strings of length <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_179\">$n$</span>, so if there was some way to decompose these strings into disjoint sets <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_180\">$B_i$</span> with cardinality <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_181\">${n+i\\choose i}\\frac{1}{2^i}$</span>, a proof using that method might work. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_182\">${n+i\\choose i}$</span> is the number of binary strings of length <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_183\">$n+i$</span> with exactly <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_184\">$i$</span> ones, since one can choose <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_185\">$i$</span> of the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_186\">$n+i$</span> positions to be ones in <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_187\">${n+i\\choose i}$</span> ways and make the rest zeroes in one way. Then we divide by the number of binary strings of length <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_188\">$i$</span>, though I'm not sure how to deduce the combinatorial significance of this. I'm most likely thinking of this the wrong way.</p>",
