  "Question": "<p>Prove that the set of discontinuities of a derivative of an everywhere differentiable function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_85\">$f(x)$</span> is of 1st category. Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_86\">$f'(x)$</span> be a derivative of an everywhere differentiable function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_87\">$f(x)$</span>. Now as the set of discontinuities of any arbitrary functions can be written as a countable union of closed sets. So let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_88\">$A$</span> be the set of discontinuities of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_89\">$f'(x)$</span>, then we can write <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_90\">$$A=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_n$$</span> where all the <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_91\">$A_n$</span> are closed set. Now suppose that for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_92\">$n=n_0$</span> the set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_93\">$A_{n_0}$</span> is not nowhere dense then there exists an open interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_94\">$(p, q)$</span> such that for any interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_95\">$I$</span> in that open interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_96\">$(p, q)$</span> we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_97\">$$I \\cap A_{n_0} \\neq \\phi$$</span> and hence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_98\">$A_{n_0}$</span> is dense in the open interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_99\">$(p, q)$</span> and as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_100\">$A_{n_0}$</span> is closed so it contains the interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_101\">$(p, q)$</span> and hence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_102\">$f'(x)$</span> is entirely discontinuous on the open interval <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_103\">$(p, q)$</span>, but as the derivative of an everywhere differentiable function cannot be entirely discontinuous on an interval, so a contradiction. Is My Proof Correct??</p>",
