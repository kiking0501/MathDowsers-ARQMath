  "Question": "<p>We know that the series <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_743\">$\\sum (-1)^n/n$</span> converges, and clearly every other alternating harmonic series with the sign changing every two or more terms such as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_744\">$$\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{9}\\right)-\\cdots$$</span> must converge. My question here is that does the series below also converge? <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_745\">$$\\sum\\frac{\\textrm{sgn}(\\sin(n))}{n}\\quad\\textrm{or}\\quad\\sum\\frac{\\sin(n)}{n|\\sin(n)|}$$</span></p> <p>Loosely speaking, the sign changes every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_746\">$\\pi$</span> terms. I'd be surprised if it doesn't converge. Wolfram Mathematica, after a couple of minutes of computing, concluded the series diverges but I can't really trust it. My first approach (assuming the series converges) was that if we bundle up terms with the same sign like the example above every bundle must have three or four terms, and since the first three terms of all bundles make an alternating series I was going to fiddle with the remaining fourth terms but they don't make an alternating series so I guess there's no point in this approach.</p> <p>edit: I don't think we can use Dirichlet's test with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_747\">$$b_n=\\textrm{sgn}(\\sin(n)).$$</span> The alternating cycle here is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_748\">$\\pi$</span> and I don't believe it would bound the series. For example if the cycle was a number very slightly smaller than <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_749\">$3+1/4$</span>, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_750\">$B_n$</span> (sum of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_751\">$b_n$</span>) would get larger and larger every four bundles for some time. I believe this should happen for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_752\">$\\pi$</span> as well since it is irrational. I'm not entirely sure why but <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_753\">$|B_n|\\leq3$</span> for most small <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_754\">$n$</span> though I guess it's because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_755\">$\\pi-3$</span> is slightly smaller than <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_756\">$1/7$</span>? Anyway <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_757\">$B_{312\\ 692}=4$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_758\">$B_{625\\ 381}=5$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_759\">$B_{938\\ 070}=6$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_760\">$B_{166\\ 645\\ 135}=-7$</span>, and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_761\">$B_{824\\ 054\\ 044}=8$</span>. <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_762\">$|B_n|$</span> does not hit <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_763\">$9$</span> up to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_764\">$n=1\\ 000\\ 000\\ 000$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_765\">$B_{1\\ 000\\ 000\\ 000}=-2$</span>.</p>",
