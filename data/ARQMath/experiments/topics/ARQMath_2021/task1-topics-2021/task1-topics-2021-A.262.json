  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_546\">$a$</span> be a real number . The positive part of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_547\">$a$</span>, denoted by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_548\">$a^+$</span> is given by expression <span class=\"math-container\">$$a^+ = \\text{if } a\\geq 0 \\text{ then $a$ else } 0$$</span> The negative part of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_550\">$a$</span>, denoted by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_551\">$a^-$</span> is given by expression <span class=\"math-container\">$$a^- = \\text{if } a\\geq 0 \\text{ then $0$ else } -a$$</span> Both <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_553\">$a^+$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_554\">$a^-$</span>  are non negative and the following relationship hold <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_555\">$$ a = a^+ - a^-$$</span> Above is the text from my compiler optimization book and I cannot understand the relationship explained. How can <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_556\">$a$</span> be a real number and have positive and negative parts?</p>",
