  "Question": "<p>I am interesting in the proof of that every rational number cannot have in decimal form infinite number of digits that don't repeat (or the other way around).</p> <p>So, then is enough to prove following statement: <em>For any <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_727\">$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$</span> rational number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_728\">$\\frac{1}{n}$</span> can be represented in decimal form such that it's digits, if there are infinitely many, are repeating.</em></p> <p>If this is true, then it is true for any <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_729\">$\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n} + ... + \\frac{1}{n}$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_730\">$m$</span> times).</p>",
