  "Question": "<p>Wrt Ramsey numbers I have the following identity given to me:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_135\">$ R(m, n) \\leq R(m-1, n)+R(m, n-1) $</span></p>  <p>And i have the following bases cases: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_136\">$R(m,2)=m$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_137\">$R(2,n)=n$</span>. One has to prove that:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_138\">$R(m, n) \\leq\\left(\\begin{array}{c}{m+n-2} \\\\ {m-1}\\end{array}\\right)$</span></p>  <p>It is obvious that we have to go on splitting the two terms on the RHS into pairs of terms decrementing the indices by 1 each time. But the appearance of the combination is non-obvious.</p>",
