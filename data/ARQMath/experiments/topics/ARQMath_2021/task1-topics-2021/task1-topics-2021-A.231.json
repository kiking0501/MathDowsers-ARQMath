  "Question": "<p>So recently I have been thinking about infinity, and one of the things that I thought of was if you were able to get a defined value for the reciprocal of a transfinite (cardinal) number. So, I plugged <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_264\">$\\frac{1}{\u05d0_0}$</span> into WolframAlpha and it said the following:<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l4LUw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> img1 </a> Why is this the case? Shouldn't this be similar to this case? <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_265\">$$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{x} =0$$</span> Aren't <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_266\">$\\infty$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_267\">$\u05d0_0$</span> equal to the same value in this context? What am I missing here?</p>",
