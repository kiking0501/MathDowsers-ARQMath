  "Question": "<p>This might be silly, but here it goes.</p>  <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_655\">$P,S>0$</span> be positive real numbers that satisfy <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_656\">$\\frac{S}{n} \\ge \\sqrt[n]{P}$</span>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Does there exist a sequence of positive real numbers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_657\">$a_1,\\dots,a_n$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_658\">$S=\\sum a_i,P=\\prod a_i$</span>?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Clearly, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_659\">$\\frac{S}{n} \\ge \\sqrt[n]{P}$</span> is a necessary condition, due to the AM-GM inequality. But is it sufficient?</p>  <p>For <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_660\">$n=2$</span>, the answer is positive, as can be seen by analysing the discriminant of the associated quadratic equation. (In fact, the solvability criterion for the quadratic, namely- the non-negativity of the discriminant, is <em>equivalent</em> to the AM-GM inequality for the sum and the product).</p>  <p>What about <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_661\">$n>3$</span>?</p>",
