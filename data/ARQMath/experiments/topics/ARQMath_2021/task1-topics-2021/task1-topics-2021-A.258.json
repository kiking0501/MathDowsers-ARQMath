  "Question": "<p>Originally, i was trying to find the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_514\">$$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{h^2}}}{h}$$</span> to find out differentiabiltiy of</p>  <blockquote>   <p><span class=\"math-container\">$f(x) = \\begin{cases} e^{-1/x^2} &amp; \\text{ if } x \\ne 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ if } x = 0 \\end{cases}$</span></p> </blockquote>  <p>at 0.</p>  <p>In this case,  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_516\">$$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{h^2}}}{h}=\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{e^{x^2}}=\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{e^{x^2}}$$</span></p>  <p>So when I applied L'Hospital's rule, then its value was 0.</p>  <p>And I thought that No matter how big <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_517\">$k$</span> is,  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_518\">$$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^k}{e^x}$$</span> will be equal to zero because exponential's increase speed is much faster than polynomial's.</p>  <p>Definitely, we can also apply L'hospital's rule at here, but I think it is not proper qualitative explanation for the fact that exponential is much bigger than polynomial.</p>  <p>Is there any other approach which explains why  about this problem?</p>  <p>(In fact, I tried to use <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_519\">$\\epsilon-\\delta$</span> but how can i show that there exist some <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_520\">$M$</span> s.t. for every <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_521\">$M<x$</span> then  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_522\">$x^k<\\epsilon e^x$</span>?)</p>  <p>(And I also tried to use inequality like <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_523\">$e^x>x+1$</span>  for all <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_524\">$x>0$</span> but it only worked for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_525\">$k<1$</span>)</p>",
