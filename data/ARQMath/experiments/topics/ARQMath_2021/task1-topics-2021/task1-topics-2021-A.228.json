  "Question": "<p>Let be   <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_250\">$\\quad f(x)=\\int_{0 }^{+\\infty}cos\\left(\\frac{t^3}{3}+xt\\right) d t$</span> </p>  <p>Find the integral</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_251\">$$F(x, y)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t+x) f(t+y) d t$$</span></p>  <p>I tried exploring f(x), took it in parts, got that it converges. F(x,y) is difficult to investigate, since the product of integrals is there, I don't know what to do with it.</p>",
