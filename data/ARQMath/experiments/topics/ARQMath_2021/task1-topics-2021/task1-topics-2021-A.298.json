  "Question": "<p>I am struggling to understand the variable transformation of a Dirac delta function. More specifically, a transformation of the following type, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_816\">$$\\delta(a\\chi(z)-b) \\rightarrow \\delta(z-c)$$</span> Here, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_817\">$a, b$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_818\">$c$</span> are constants. The specific relationship between <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_819\">$\\chi(z)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_820\">$z$</span> is, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_821\">$$\\chi(z)=\\int{\\frac{1}{H(z)}dz}$$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_822\">$H(z)$</span> is a non-zero, positive and smoothly varying function of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_823\">$z$</span>. In the context of my Physics problem, for the sake of the interested audience, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_824\">$H(z)$</span> is the Hubble parameter of the Universe while <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_825\">$\\chi(z)$</span> is the comoving distance and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_826\">$z$</span> is the redshift of any time in the past.</p>  <p><strong><em>So, let me add what I have done so far:</em></strong> </p>  <p>I start by defining the Dirac delta function in the form a unit step function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_827\">$\\Theta (a\\chi(z)-b)$</span>as, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_828\">$$\\frac{d}{d(a\\chi(z))}\\Theta(a\\chi(z)-b)=\\delta(a\\chi(z)-b)$$</span> Then converting this in the form of z using the chain rule as, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_829\">$$\\frac{d}{dz}\\Theta(a\\chi(z)-b)\\frac{dz}{d(a\\chi(z))}$$</span> Using the relation with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_830\">$H(z)$</span>, we can write the equation as, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_831\">$$\\frac{d}{dz}\\Theta(a\\chi(z)-b)\\frac{H(z)}{a}$$</span> Also, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_832\">$\\chi(z)$</span> can also be replaced by the integral as well, so that left side containing the unit step function can be written as, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_833\">$$\\frac{H(z)}{a}\\frac{d}{dz}\\Theta(\\ a\\int_0^z{\\frac{1}{H(z')}dz'}-b)$$</span>.</p>  <p>After this, I am not sure what else to try. Hopefully, this addition helps. Also, please point out an error if you see one. </p>",
