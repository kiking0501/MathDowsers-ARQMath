  "Question": "<p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_13\">$+(+x) = +x$</span></p> <p>but why is <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_14\">$-(-x) = +x$</span>???</p> <p>What's the reason behind the rule, it's really basic and \"obvious\" because a no turns a no to a yes</p> <p>But I don't want to reason like that, lol. So how would you explain it? Do I just say on a real number line <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_15\">$-x$</span> makes a turnaround and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_16\">$-(-x)$</span> would turn it positive again?</p> <p>Also if I say for example: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_17\">$-x = 5$</span> then I do have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_18\">$-(-x) = -5$</span> Is it correct? It wouldn't matter, right?</p> <p>(Btw: I don't know if the tag \"elementary-number-theory\" is correct)</p> <p>**The question is different to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_19\">$(-x)*(-x)=x$</span></p>",
