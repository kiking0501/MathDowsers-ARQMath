  "Question": "<p>For linear programming, it's well known that the dual of the dual is the primal. I'm wondering if it is the case for Lagrange duality, and I'm having a hard time showing this.</p>  <p>Notationally, let the primal problem be:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_585\">$$\\text{minimize } \\quad f_0(x)$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_586\">$$\\text{subject to } \\quad f_i(x) \\leq 0, \\quad i = 1, \\dots, m$$</span></p>  <p>And the dual be:</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_587\">$$\\text{minimize } \\quad -g(\\lambda) = - \\inf_x L(x, \\lambda)$$</span> <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_588\">$$\\text{subject to } \\quad -\\lambda \\leq 0$$</span></p>  <p>Where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_589\">$L(x,\\lambda) = f_0(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i f_i(x)$</span> is the Lagrangian.</p>  <p>I suspect it isn't true in general that the dual of dual is the primal. However, intuitively when I hear the term dual I assume that the dual of the dual should be the primal, so this got me confused. </p>",
