  "Question": "<p>I want to see if there is any elementary way to prove the following assertion about matrices over division rings (such as not using Wedderburn's theory or tensoring techniques).</p>  <p><em>If an <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_1\">$n\\times n$</span> matrix over a division ring has left inverse, then it also has right inverse.</em></p>  <p>The assertion has elementary proof for matrices over fields, but I am considering over division rings. </p>  <p>One can give some hints also.</p>",
