  "Question": "<p>Here's the question- Find the maximum area of an isosceles triangle inscribed in the ellipse <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_130\">$x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1$</span>. My teacher solved it by considering two arbitrary points on the ellipse to be vertices of the triangle, being <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_131\">$(a\\cos\\theta, b\\sin \\theta)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_132\">$(a\\cos\\theta, -b\\sin \\theta)$</span>. (Let's just say <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_133\">$\\theta$</span> is theta) and then proceeded with the derivative tests(which i understood) But, he didn't indicate what our <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_134\">$\\theta$</span> was,and declared that these points always lie on an ellipse. Why so? And even if they do, what's the guarantee that points of such a form will be our required vertices? One more thing, I'd appreciate it if you could suggest another way of solving this problem. Thank you!</p>",
