  "Question": "<p>I've been given the function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_70\">$$f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(2n+1)(2x)^{2n}$$</span> And I have to evaluate <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_71\">$f(1/4)$</span> so find the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_72\">$$f(1/4)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n}}$$</span> I would appreciate any help with this as I am pretty lost.</p>",
