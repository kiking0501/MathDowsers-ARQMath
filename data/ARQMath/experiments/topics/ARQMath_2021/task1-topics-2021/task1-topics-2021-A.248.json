  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_442\">$G$</span> be an abelian group with even order and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_443\">$M:=\\{g\\in G:g^2=e\\}$</span>.</p>  <p>It is easy to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_444\">$M$</span> is a sugroup of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_445\">$G$</span> and the number of elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_446\">$M$</span> must be a power of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_447\">$2$</span>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I want to prove that the product of the elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_448\">$G$</span> (which in this case is equal to the product of the elements of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_449\">$M$</span>) is not the identity element <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_450\">$e$</span>, if and only if #<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_451\">$M=2$</span> (this means that there is only one element with order <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_452\">$2$</span>). I found this claim when I studied the Wilson criterion for the primality of a number.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The case #<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_453\">$M=4$</span> is easy. If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_454\">$a,b\\in M$</span>, we can show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_455\">$ab$</span> is not <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_456\">$a,b,e$</span>, hence must be some other element <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_457\">$c$</span> and we get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_458\">$abc=c^2=e$</span>. But what about #<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_459\">$M=8$</span>? If we have the elements <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_460\">$e,a,b,c,d,f,g,h$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_461\">$ab=c$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_462\">$df=g$</span>, the product would be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_463\">$h$</span> which is impossible considering my claim. </p>  <p>Who can complete my proof ?</p>",
