  "Question": "<p>Let a family have two children. It is known that one of the children is a boy. What is the probability that both the children are boys.</p> <p>So for this we build the sample space <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_595\">$S=\\{(b,b)(b,g)(g,g)\\}$</span></p> <p>Let our event E be the case where both children are boys</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_596\">$E=\\{ (b,b) \\}$</span></p> <p>Let the conditional be F</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_597\">$F=\\{(b,g),(b,b)\\}$</span></p> <p>Hence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_598\">$P(E|F)=\\frac{P(E\\cap F)}{P(F)}=\\frac{1/3}{2/3}=\\frac{1}{2}$</span></p> <p>But the answer in my book is given as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_599\">$\\frac{1}{3}$</span> and I can't seem to understand why.</p>",
