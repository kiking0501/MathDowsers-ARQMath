  "Question": "<p>Is there a differentiable function <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_664\">$f:\\mathbb R \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$</span> such that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_665\">$f(\\mathbb Q) \\subseteq \\mathbb Q$</span>, but <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_666\">$f'(\\mathbb Q) \\not \\subseteq \\mathbb Q$</span>? A friend of mine asserted this without giving any examples. I seriously doubt it, but I had hard time trying to disprove it since analysis isn't really my thing. I can't even think of any class of differentiable functions with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_667\">$f(\\mathbb Q) \\subseteq \\mathbb Q$</span> other than the rational functions.</p>",
