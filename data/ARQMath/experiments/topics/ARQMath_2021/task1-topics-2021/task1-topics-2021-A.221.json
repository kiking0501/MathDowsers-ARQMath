  "Question": "<p>This is just for fun and inspired by <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3866025/estimating-pi-using-only-2s/\">Estimating pi, using only 2s</a>.</p> <p>For a positive integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_143\">$n$</span>, let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_144\">$f(n)$</span> denote the minimum number of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_145\">$2$</span>s needed to express <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_146\">$n$</span> using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, together with the ability to concatenate <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_147\">$2$</span>s, so for example <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_148\">$2 \\times 22^2 + \\frac{222}{2}$</span> is a valid expression. Other variants involving different sets of allowed operations are possible, of course. This function is very far from monotonic, so to smooth it out let's also consider</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_149\">$$g(n) = \\text{max}_{1 \\le m \\le n} f(m).$$</span></p> <p>For example,</p> <ul> <li><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_150\">$f(1) = 2$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_151\">$1 = \\frac 22$</span>)</li> <li><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_152\">$f(11) = 3$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_153\">$11 = \\frac{22}{2}$</span>)</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What can you say about <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_154\">$f(n)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_155\">$g(n)$</span>? Can you give exact values for small values of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_156\">$n$</span>? Can you give (asymptotic or exact) upper bounds? Lower bounds?</p> </blockquote> <p>As a simple example we can write any positive integer <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_157\">$n$</span> in the form <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_158\">$2^k + n'$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_159\">$n' < 2^k$</span> (<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_160\">$2^k$</span> is just the leading digit in the binary expansion of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_161\">$n$</span>), which gives <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_162\">$f(n) \\le f(k) + 1 + f(n')$</span>. If we write <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_163\">$\\ell(n) = \\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor$</span> then iterating this gives something like</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_164\">$$g(n) \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell(n)} \\left( g(k) + 1 \\right).$$</span></p> <p>This gives an upper bound growing something like <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_165\">$\\ell(n) \\ell^2(n) \\ell^3(n) \\dots$</span> which I think is pessimistic. For example, in my answer to the linked question I show that</p> <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_166\">$$f(14885392687) \\le 36$$</span></p> <p>and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_167\">$\\ell(14885392687) = 33$</span> so maybe we can expect something as good as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_168\">$g(n) = O(\\log n)$</span> for an upper bound. I have no idea about a lower bound, other than to write down an upper bound on the number of possible expressions that can be made with a given number of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_169\">$2$</span>s.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> A related question involving <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_170\">$4$</span>s and more allowed operations: <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/93729/how-many-fours-are-needed-to-represent-numbers-up-to-n\">How many fours are needed to represent numbers up to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_171\">$N$</span>?</a></p>",
