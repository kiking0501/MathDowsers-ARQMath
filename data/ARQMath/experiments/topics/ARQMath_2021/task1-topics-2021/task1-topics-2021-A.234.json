  "Question": "<p>I'm having some struggles with an aspect about something apparently trivial about Sard's theorem, but couldn't find anything online.</p>  <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_297\">$f$</span> be a polynomial.</p>  <p>According to Sard's theorem, the image <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_298\">$f(Z)$</span> of the set of critical values  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_299\">$$Z = \\{a \\in X : f'(a) = 0\\}$$</span> has measure zero.</p>  <p>What if I want to show that the set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_300\">$Z$</span> itself has measure zero in the domain of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_301\">$f$</span>?</p>  <p>I feel like it's so simple but i just can't get behind it.</p>",
