  "Question": "<p>The integral given is: <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_252\">$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\big\\lbrace\\frac{1}{x}\\big\\rbrace \\big\\lbrace\\frac{1}{1-x}\\big\\rbrace \\big\\lbrace1-\\frac{1}{x}\\big\\rbrace dx$$</span> where  <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_253\">$\\big\\lbrace x\\big\\rbrace$</span> represents the fractional part of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_254\">$x$</span></p>  <p>I first tried breaking it using a piecewise definition but I couldn't figure out how to do it as there wasn't any consistent pattern that I could spot. </p>  <p>I tried graphing it to get an idea but that also didn't get me anywhere.</p>  <p>Finally, I tried using the property of definite integral that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_255\">$\\int_{0}^{a}f(x)dx=\\int_{0}^{a}f(a-x)dx$</span> but the first and seccond terms remained the same and the last term changed but not it did not lead to any noticeable changes.</p>  <p>I am stuck now. Any help would be appreciated.</p>",
