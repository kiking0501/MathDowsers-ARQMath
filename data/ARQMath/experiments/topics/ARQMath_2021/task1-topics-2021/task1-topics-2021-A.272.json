  "Question": "<p>Apparently <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_611\">$\\sqrt{ab}$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_612\">$\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}$</span> is only true if a and b are both positive or if a is negative and b is positive or if a is positive and b is negative. In other words, a and b can't both be negative.</p>  <p><strong>Is it possible to algebraically prove this? Or is it just a result of the way the square root function is defined?</strong> </p>  <p>I know of 1 way to prove this radical property, but I'm still not sure why it won't work for negative numbers.</p>  <p>Let x = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_613\">$\\sqrt{ab}$</span>.</p>  <p>Let y = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_614\">$\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}$</span></p>  <p>Square both sides for both equations.</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_615\">$x^2 = (\\sqrt{ab})^2 = ab$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_616\">$y^2 = (\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b})^2 = (\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b})(\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}) = (\\sqrt{a})^2(\\sqrt{b})^2 = ab$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_617\">$\\therefore x^2 = y^2$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_618\">$x^2-y^2=0$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_619\">$(x+y)(x-y)=0$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_620\">$\\therefore x = y$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_621\">$x = -y$</span></p>  <p>Or</p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_622\">$\\therefore y = x$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_623\">$y = -x$</span></p>  <hr>  <p>A lot of people will go through this line of reasoning (shown below) in order to justify why a and b can't both be negative. </p>  <p>Considering that mathematicians define <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_624\">$i^2=-1$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_625\">$i = \\sqrt{-1}$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_626\">$1 = \\sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1} = (i)(i) = i^2 = -1  $</span></p>  <p>But this is only a specific instance where this property fails us. This isn't a  rigorous or at least satisfying proof of why <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_627\">$\\sqrt{ab}$</span> = <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_628\">$\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}$</span> can only be true if a and b are not both negative.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I just started learning about complex and imaginary numbers and I am no means an expert in  mathematical proofs, so if you do know the answer to this question please try (if possible) your best to answer the question without using too much complex or high-order math that I won't be able to understand. </p>",
