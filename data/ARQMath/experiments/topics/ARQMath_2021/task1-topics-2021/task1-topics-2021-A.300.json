  "Question": "<p>So I supposed to find out if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_837\">$$f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+\\ln^2 x}$$</span> is uniformly continuous on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_838\">$I=(0,\\infty)$</span> So I have been thinking a lot. Could I say that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_839\">$f$</span> is continuous on <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_840\">$[0,1]$</span> and therefore uniformly continuous here? Or is this not valid, because <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_841\">$\\ln$</span> is not defined at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_842\">$x=0$</span>? And then say that the derivate is bounded at <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_843\">$[1,\\infty]$</span>?</p>",
