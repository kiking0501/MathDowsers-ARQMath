  "Question": "<blockquote>   <p>\"The number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_483\">$\\frac 16 \\pi^2$</span> turns up surprisingly often and frequently in unexpected places.\" - Julian Havil, <em>Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>It is well-known, especially in 'pop math,' that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_484\">$$\\zeta(2)=\\frac1{1^2}+\\frac1{2^2}+\\frac1{3^2}+\\cdots = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}.$$</span> <a href=\"http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~wkhon/random/tutorial/pi-squared-over-six.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Euler's proof of which</a> is quite nice. <strong>I would like to know where else this constant appears non-trivially.</strong> This is a bit broad, so here are the specifics of my question:</p>  <ol> <li>We can fiddle with the zeta function at arbitrary even integer values to eek out a <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_485\">$\\zeta(2)$</span>. I would consider these 'appearances' of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_486\">$\\frac 16 \\pi^2$</span> to be redundant and ask that they not be mentioned unless you have some wickedly compelling reason to include it.</li> <li>By 'non-trivially,' I mean that I do not want converging series, integrals, etc. where it is obvious that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_487\">$c\\pi$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_488\">$c\\pi^2$</span> with <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_489\">$c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$</span> can simply be 'factored out' in some way such that it looks like <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_490\">$c\\pi^2$</span> was included after-the-fact so that said series, integral, etc. would equal <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_491\">$\\frac 16 \\pi^2$</span>. For instance, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_492\">$\\sum \\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\cdot2^n} = \\frac 16 \\pi^2$</span>, but clearly the appearance of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_493\">$\\frac 16\\pi^2$</span> here is contrived. (But, if you have an answer that seems very interesting but you're unsure if it fits the 'non-trivial' bill, keep in mind that nobody will actually stop you from posting it.)</li> </ol>  <p>I hope this is specific enough. <strong>This was my attempt at formally saying 'I want to see all the interesting ways we can make <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_494\">$\\frac 16 \\pi^2$</span>.'</strong> With all that being said, I will give my favorite example as an answer below! :<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_495\">$)$</span></p>  <hr>  <p>There used to be a chunk of text explaining why this question should be reopened here. It was reopened, so I removed it.</p>",
