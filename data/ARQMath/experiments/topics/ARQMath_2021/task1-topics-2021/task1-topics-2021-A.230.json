  "Question": "<p>So I went through the definition of Ramsey number and I have a basic question.</p> <p>Definition: For any given number of colours, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_256\">$c$</span>, and any given integers <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_257\">$n_1, \u2026, n_c$</span>, there is a number, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_258\">$R(n_1, \u2026, n_c)$</span>, such that if the edges of a complete graph of order <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_259\">$R(n_1, ..., n_c)$</span> are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, it must contain a complete subgraph of order ni whose edges are all colour i.</p> <p>Question: Is the multicolour Ramsey number <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_260\">$R(n_1,n_2,..n_c) $</span>same as <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_261\">$R(n_2,n_1,..n_c) $</span>or any other permutation of<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_262\">$ {n_1,n_2,..n_c}$</span>? The definition seems to imply so, I just want to verify if I'm thinking right. I have read that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_263\">$R(m,n)=R(n,m)$</span> but nothing about symmetricity of multicolour Ramsey numbers.</p>",
