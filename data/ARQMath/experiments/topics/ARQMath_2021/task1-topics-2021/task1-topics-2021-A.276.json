  "Question": "<p>I think what I need to do is find the value of <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_651\">$n$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_652\">$n^k<a^n$</span>. I know that this value occurs whenever <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_653\">$n>k\\log_an$</span>, however I don't understand how to interpret this result into a general <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_654\">$N$</span> to pick as a maximum for the sequence convergence. What am I missing here?</p>",
