  "Question": "<p>I was going through the text \"Discrete Mathematics and its Application\" by Kenneth Rosen (5th Edition) where I am across the definition of equivalence relation and felt that it is one sided.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Definition: <strong>A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>Now let us analyze the situation of what equivalence is meant to us intuitively.</p>  <p>Let there be a binary relation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_336\">$R$</span> defined on a set <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_337\">$A$</span>. Now we suppose that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_338\">$R$</span> be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.</p>  <p>So we have for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_339\">$a,b,c \\in A$</span> </p>  <ol> <li><p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_340\">$a R a$</span> (by the reflexive property of R)</p></li> <li><p>if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_341\">$a R b$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_342\">$b R a$</span>  (by the symmetric property of R)</p></li> <li><p>if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_343\">$a R b$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_344\">$b R c$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_345\">$aRc$</span> (by the transitive property of R)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Intuitively we can satisfy ourselves with the fact that the above are the necessary conditions for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_346\">$R$</span> to be equivalent. So \"if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_347\">$R$</span> is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_348\">$R$</span> is an equivalence relation\"</p>  <p>Now working our intuition for equivalence relation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_349\">$\\sim$</span> we note the following.</p>  <p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_350\">$\\sim$</span> be an equivalence relation on a set A, then for <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_351\">$a,b,c \\in A$</span> we have,</p>  <ol> <li><p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_352\">$a \\sim a$</span> (by the intuitive knowledge of what <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_353\">$\\sim$</span> means)</p></li> <li><p>if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_354\">$a\\sim b$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_355\">$b \\sim a$</span> (by the intuitive knowledge of what <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_356\">$\\sim$</span> means)</p></li> <li><p>if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_357\">$a\\sim b$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_358\">$b \\sim c$</span> then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_359\">$a\\sim c$</span> (by the intuitive knowledge of what <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_360\">$\\sim$</span> means)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Now we see that (1) implies <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_361\">$\\sim$</span> is reflexive, (2) implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_362\">$\\sim$</span> is symmetric and (3) implies that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_363\">$\\sim$</span> is transitive.</p>  <p>So we have \"if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_364\">$\\sim$</span> is an equivalent relation then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_365\">$\\sim$</span> is reflexive, symmetric and transitive\"</p>  <p>From the two intuitive implications we can conclude that <strong>A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</strong> and not what the book says. This definition makes quite sense unlike the book definition which says that if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_366\">$R$</span> fails to be either reflexive or symmetric or transitive then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_367\">$R$</span> may or may not be an equivalence relation, which after all gives a weird feeling.</p>  <p>Correct me if my logic is wrong.</p>",
