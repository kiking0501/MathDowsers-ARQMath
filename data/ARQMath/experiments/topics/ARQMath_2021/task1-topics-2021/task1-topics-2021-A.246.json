So, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_423\">$\\theta=\\frac{180^\\circ}{n}$</span>.</p> <p>Then we get <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_424\">$$\\csc(\\theta)=\\csc(2\\theta)+\\csc(3\\theta)$$</span> Not sure quite how to proceed from there- using double and triple angle formulae doesn't seem to work</p>",
