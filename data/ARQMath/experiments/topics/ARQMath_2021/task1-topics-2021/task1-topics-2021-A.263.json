  "Question": "<p>I am not <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_557\">$100\\%$</span> clear as to what constitutes the difference between a <a href=\"https://en.wikipediA.2org/wiki/Rule_of_inference\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rule of inference</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">material conditional</a>, at least in classical logic. I am using the truth-functional definition of the material conditional, commonly visualised through its truth table, but I'm not entirely sure what the <em>formal</em> definition of a rule of inference is. The wikipedia article defines it to be a particular kind of <em>logical form</em>, which seems to be a term from philosophical logic that I'm not familiar with, but reading that article didn't really answer my question. It pertains more to the mathematical side of things, and I am specifically interested in the interplay between the concepts on the syntactic and semantic level. As far as I can tell, any rule of inference can be 'captured' by a corresponding material conditional: if we take modus ponens as a well-known example, what is the difference between <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_558\">$$(a\\land (a\\to b))\\to b$$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_559\">$${a\\to b,\\text{ } a \\over b}?$$</span> On a functional level, both statements seem to be expressing the same thing. What determines the need to use two separate terms and notations, and what, if anything, separates them?</p>",
