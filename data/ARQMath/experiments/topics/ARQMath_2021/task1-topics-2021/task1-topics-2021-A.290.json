  "Question": "<p>I am asked to prove by induction that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_774\">$7\\times11^{2n+1}-3^{4n-1}$</span> is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_775\">$10$</span>.</p> <p>I wonder whether there is a more direct method, for example factorizing by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_776\">$10$</span>. If an expression is divisible by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_777\">$10$</span>, does this mean that I can factorize it by <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_778\">$10$</span>?</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>",
