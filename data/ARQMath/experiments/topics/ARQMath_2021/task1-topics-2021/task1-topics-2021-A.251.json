  "Question": "<p>I've been trying to solve this for hours, but I just can't seem to do it. And yes, I know I have to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_480\">$(k+2)^{\\frac{1}{k+2}} < ... < (k + 1)^{\\frac{1}{k+1}}$</span> from the starting assumption that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_481\">$(k+1)^{\\frac{1}{k+1}} < k^{\\frac{1}{k}}$</span>. Any hints would be highly welcome.</p>",
