  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_736\">$a_{n}$</span> be decreasing and positive. Then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_737\">$\\sum a_{k}$</span> converges implies <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_738\">$\\lim _{n \\rightarrow+\\infty} n a_{n}=0$</span>.</p>  <p>I think since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_739\">$na_n$</span> is positive, the only thing to do is to find an upper bound for the sequence. But I don't know how to split the sequence to form the upper bound.</p>",
