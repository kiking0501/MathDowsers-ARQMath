  "Question": "<p>Let <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_563\">$a$</span>,<span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_564\">$b$</span> be relatively prime integers which are both greater than or equal to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_565\">$2$</span> . Show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_566\">$(a/b)^2$</span> cannot be an integer.</p>  <p>I have tried to use contradiction to prove this result, but I am not sure that my idea is correct or not. Below is my idea (not a complete proof).</p>  <p>Suppose <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_567\">$(a/b)^2$</span> be an integer. We have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_568\">$a/b$</span> is an integer. Then, we have <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_569\">$a=bk$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_570\">$k$</span> is an integer since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_571\">$b$</span> divides <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_572\">$a$</span>. Since <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_573\">$a,b$</span> are relatively prime, therefore <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_574\">$b$</span> must be <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_575\">$1$</span>. Hence, contradiction arises. I am not sure that my idea is correct or not, could anyone help me to check it? If my idea is wrong, could you give me a idea to do this question?</p>",
