  "Question": "<p>A fair coin is flipped repeatedly until it turns up tails five times. What is the expected number of heads before that happens?</p> <p>Based on the link given in the comment, I have found it can be solved using the recursion <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_600\">$E(n)=\\frac{1}{2}(E(n)+1)+\\frac{1}{2}(E(n-1))$</span> which is equivalent to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_601\">$E(n)=E(n-1)+1$</span>. Is it correct?</p>",
