  "Question": "<p>I was looking at the graph of the equation <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_225\">$x^{x^y}=y$</span> (<a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oew86z4f8q\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Desmos link</a>). This graph has two components that cross at the point <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_226\">$(1/e^e,1/e)=(e^{-e},e^{-1})$</span>.</p> <p>Component 1 (as I'll call it) is the component <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_227\">$x^y=y$</span> which has the simple parametrization <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_228\">$$(x,y)=\\left(t^{1/t},t\\right),\\qquad0<t<\\infty.$$</span> Component 2 is a path between the points <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_229\">$(0,0)$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_230\">$(0,1)$</span>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Does component 2 also admit a parameterization?</p> </blockquote> <p>To clarify: Component 2 is a path so of course it abstractly admits a parameterization, but I'm asking if there is a parametrization that we can actually write down algebraically in terms of elementary functions.</p> <hr /> <p>My motivation for this question is from the limiting behavior of the sequence <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_231\">$0,1,x,x^x,x^{x^x},x^{x^{x^x}},\\ldots$</span>, whose behavior is closely related to the solutions to <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_232\">$x^{x^y}=y$</span>. In particular, if <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_233\">$x$</span> is less than <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_234\">$e^{-e}$</span> then this sequence alternates between the upper and lower parts of component 2.</p>",
