If <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_714\">$(x_n)$</span> is bounded, then <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_715\">$\\exists M \\in \\mathbb{R}$</span> such that </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_716\">\\begin{align}|x_n| \\leq M ~\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\tag{1} \\end{align}</span></p>  <p>Alternatively, I think this means that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_717\">$M$</span> could be a supremum of the sequence and another way to rewrite <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_718\">$(1)$</span> is given any <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_719\">$\\epsilon > 0$</span></p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_720\">\\begin{align} x_n + \\epsilon \\leq M \\tag{2}\\end{align}</span></p>  <p>Choose <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_721\">$\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{x_n}$</span>. Then </p>  <p><span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_722\">\\begin{align} x_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{1}{x_n} \\leq M \\implies x_n + \\epsilon \\leq M \\tag{3}\\end{align}</span></p>  <p>Thus I conclude that the inequality holds <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_723\">$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}$</span> and that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_724\">$(x_n)$</span> is convergent. Thus by the Monotone Sequence Convergence Theorem, <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_725\">$(x_n)$</span> is convergent.</p>  <hr>  <p>The part I am not sure about is my reasoning to show that <span class=\"math-container\" id=\"q_726\">$x_n$</span> being bounded is correct or not. </p>",
