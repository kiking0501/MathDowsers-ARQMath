    <p>
    This demo facillitates users to view the result of the MathCQA task, in particular, the result from the MathDowsers' team.
    <ul>
        <li><p>At first, select a question from the <a onclick="openTab('question_panel')">ARQMath Queston Panel</a>. The available  questions are query topics from the ARQMath Lab 2020 and 2021, selected from real-life questions in the Math StackExchange forum in 2019 and 2020. After selecting a question, one might then click on the "View MathDowsers' Runs" button to navigate to the "View Ranked Answers" panel. (Note that the panel is not accessible without a selected question.)

        <li><p> From the "View Ranked Answers" panel, users might then explore different lists of potential answers and their accessed relevance with respect to the selected question. The displayed lists of answers (or <i>runs</i>) are retrieved and ranked by MathDowsers using forum posts in 2010 to 2018 from the Math Stack Exchange corpus. The<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/paper-05.pdf" target="_blank"> ARQMath Working Paper 2021</a> has a full documentation on the runs.
